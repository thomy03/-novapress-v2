        "title": "It’s time for politicians to return Bondi Beach to the people",
        "summary": "This crisis requires politicians to stop partisan politicking at the beach and go back to Canberra to work together.",
        "content": "When the issue of gun control was raised soon after the attack, former prime minister John Howard, slavishly echoed by sections of the media, said any such talk was a distraction from the real issue, which was antisemitism.\n\nHoward, with all his stature, gave the cue for the partisan politicking that followed, a lot of it taking place on the site of the massacre.\n\nWhen the issue of gun control was raised soon after the attack, John Howard said any such talk was a distraction from the real issue, which was antisemitism. Credit: AP\n\nGun control is just about the most basic and commonsense issue to raise in the immediate aftermath of such an atrocity.\n\nAs the Herald and The Age reported on Thursday, in a story about ASIO’s contact with the younger alleged shooter: “all official sources across multiple agencies” said there was “consensus in the law enforcement community that Australia’s firearms monitoring systems are badly outdated and plagued by siloing and jurisdictional inconsistencies”.\n\nSuch a polarised reaction – if you are talking about X, then you are wilfully and maliciously ignoring Y – is a large part of the problem we are now faced with.\n\nLoading\n\nWe cannot allow the politics of the internet, the zero-sum reasoning of the anonymous troll-hordes, to filter into our civic life.\n\nWe can and should discuss all the causative factors of this event – and they include gun control, national security, immigration screening, intelligence sharing and of course, the most decisive one – antisemitism in all its forms.\n\nAnd it does have many forms. There is a huge gap between the protests of university students and the murderous actions of ISIS-inspired radicals.\n\nWe have told ourselves a story about the pluralism and tolerance we like to think defines Australia.\n\nBut can we cling to the narrative that we are the world’s most successful multicultural nation when Jewish children go to school under armed guard?\n\nJohn Howard gave the cue for the partisan politicking that followed – including a visit to the flower memorial by Barnaby Joyce and Pauline Hanson. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nCan we condemn Pauline Hanson for wearing the burqa in a horrible parliamentary stunt while ignoring the fact that there are parts of Sydney where a man might feel unsafe wearing a yarmulke?\n\nA lazy byproduct of Australia’s relative comfort – we are one of the richest, best educated and most peaceful countries in the world – is our complacency in that comfort.\n\nBondi shattered that.\n\nLoading\n\nEver since the horror of October 7, we have debated the war in Gaza, and the public has become increasingly horrified by the death and suffering there.\n\nBut we have undoubtedly allowed antisemitism to slip into the edges of our discourse.\n\nCertain communities and institutions (rightly) maintained the line that criticism of the Israeli government’s actions cannot be conflated with antisemitism.\n\nBut those same communities, the ones that pride themselves on their progressivism, have become increasingly illiberal over the issue of Israel.\n\nSome have used their horror over the actions of the Israeli government as a pretext to attack Jewish people.\n\nAs a result, Jewish Australians have been doxxed and sidelined from cultural festivals. Jewish kids feel unwelcome at some of our best universities.\n\nPro-Palestine rally organisers have failed to condemn, let alone cast out, the antisemitism and extremism that exists in their movement.\n\nMany Jewish Australians say they feel unsafe and unwelcome in the same quarters of cultural life that their forebears helped build during the great wave of post-war middle-European migration.\n\nLoading\n\nWe can blame our government and the prime minister for all of it, but it is more pragmatic to focus on our own accountability where it applies.\n\nAnthony Albanese is no Jacinda Ardern; the former Kiwi prime minister who was remarkable in her response to the Christchurch mosque massacre in 2019, and whose displays of empathy led to a global conversation about the nature of true leadership.\n\nBut perhaps the most tragic part of the eruption in anger over Bondi is that it fulfils the goals of terrorism.\n\nIslamic terrorists, just like Nazis, hate Australian pluralism.\n\nThey hate the spirit of mutual tolerance that has most usually defined Australian society.\n\nThey want to rupture it.\n\nThey want to sow division and foment bitter arguments between citizens who were previously co-existing peacefully.\n\nThey don’t want a Bondi Beach replete with laughing children and loping surfers.\n\nLoading\n\nThey want Bondi Beach covered in blood, first, and next, a Bondi Beach populated by citizens and politicians blaming one another.\n\nCausation is a tortured area of law, and of life, and the “but for” test is not considered an optimal tool for harms which have multiple causes.\n\nThat’s why jurists have overlaid it with something else, something that non-lawyers can understand just fine: the commonsense test.\n\nCommon sense is what is needed from our leaders ",

        "content": "Durch die Wucht des Aufpralls entgleiste der Zug, wobei jedoch niemand der Insassen verletzt wurde. Die Herde bestand aus etwa 100 Tieren, die die Gleise überqueren wollten – vermutlich auf der Suche nach Nahrung. Der Zug war im indischen Bundesstaat Assam in Richtung der Hauptstadt Neu-Delhi unterwegs.\n\nRegierungschef ordnet Untersuchung an\n\nRegierungschef Sarma teilte mit, dass ihn die Nachricht über den Tod der Elefanten traurig gemacht habe. Er ordnete eine Untersuchung des »tief verstörenden Unfalls« an. Es müssten Schritte unternommen werden, um die Wildtierkorridore Assams sicherer zu machen.",

        "content": "Photo of Andrew lying on laps at Sandringham in new Epstein files\n\n8 hours ago Share Save Noor Nanji Royal correspondent Share Save\n\nUS Department of Justice\n\nA photo of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lying on the laps of women is among the thousands of Epstein files which have been released by the US Department of Justice. In the picture, convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell hovers in the background smiling at the former prince. The photo appears to have been taken in the saloon room at Sandringham, the royal estate in Norfolk. The emergence of the photo will add to scrutiny on Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, after he was stripped of his remaining titles and honours over his links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nTwo of the photos also show Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, in the company of women whose faces are covered by black squares. Ms Ferguson's representatives declined to comment. Simply appearing in the photos or documents is not evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nUS Department of Justice Sarah Ferguson is pictured in some of the photos\n\nThe heavily-redacted tranche of some of the so-called Epstein files - the long-awaited documents relating to the US Department of Justice's investigations into Epstein - were released on Friday night. The documents were highly anticipated after Congress passed a law mandating the files be released in their entirety by 19 December. They contain photos of the interiors of Epstein's homes, his overseas travels and celebrities including US President Bill Clinton, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Michael Jackson. President Donald Trump was hardly mentioned in the files. Many of those identified in other releases, including President Trump, have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.\n\nIn the undated picture of Andrew, the former prince - now 65 - looks much younger. He is smiling with his eyes closed. The faces of those with him, who are sitting in front of a grand fireplace, have been redacted with black squares. In another picture, he appears to be at Royal Ascot with Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nUS Department of Justice Jeffrey Epstein, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Ghislaine Maxwell appear to be in the royal box at Ascot\n\nAlso among the files are undated photos of Maxwell standing outside the door of 10 Downing Street. In the picture she is alone and no context was provided with the photo about why she is there or when the image was taken.\n\nUS Department of Justice\n\nThe issue over Andrew’s friendship with Epstein has continued to dog the royals. The King stripped his younger brother of his prince title following weeks of intense pressure over his links to the paedophile financier. He is also expected to shortly move out of his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge. It came after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - as he is now known - gave up his other royal titles, including the Duke of York, after more questions and allegations about his private life. At the start of this year, emails showed that he had stayed in contact with Epstein for longer than he had previously admitted. In a posthumous memoir published in October, Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Epstein - repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions. Andrew has always strenuously denied the claims. Andrew has also faced calls from Democrats in the US Congress to give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein's activities. He had not replied to the request by the end of their deadline last month. Separately, two photos of Ms Ferguson - then the Duchess of York - have emerged in the document dump. One shows her standing on a pavement next to an unidentified woman holding a shopping bag. In the other, she is sitting cross legged on a green sofa.\n\nUS Department of Justice",

        "summary": "Capable of creating “nearly perfect” face swaps during live video chats, Haotian has made millions, mainly via Telegram. But its main channel vanished after WIRED's inquiry into scammers using the app.",
        "content": "The Chinese-language artificial intelligence app Haotian is so effective that it’s made millions of dollars selling its face-swapping technology on Telegram. The service integrates easily with messaging platforms like WhatsApp and WeChat and claims that users can tweak up to 50 settings—including the ability to adjust things like cheekbone size and eye position—to help mimic the face they are impersonating. But while Haotian is a robust and versatile platform, researchers and WIRED’s own analysis have found that the service has been marketing to so-called “pig butchering” scammers and those running online fraud operations in Southeast Asia.\n\nScammers have used Haotian and other deepfake tools to more easily substantiate their deceptions by allowing victims to “videochat” with the character they believe they have been talking to as part of an investment opportunity, friendship, or even romantic relationship. Analysis by the cryptocurrency tracing firm Elliptic of four cryptocurrency wallets linked to Haotian shows the company has received at least $3.9 million in payments in recent years, including money from cryptocurrency wallets linked to alleged criminal activity, including fraud. Additionally, almost half of its payments had ties to a scam marketplace sanctioned by the US government, Elliptic says.\n\nHieu Minh Ngo, a reformed criminal hacker turned cybercrime investigator at the Vietnamese scam-fighting nonprofit ChongLuaDao, says that Haotian, which emerged around 2021, was “one of the first of its kind and very popular.” Ngo has conducted extensive research into Haotian and its operations. “Its results are nearly perfect,” he says. “And they are getting better and better every day. If you check in the crypto wallet, you will see the money coming in every single day.”\n\nHaotian is just one part of the wider tech ecosystem that has emerged around Southeast Asia’s booming cybercrime industry and forced labor scam compounds. And as face swapping and other video deepfake tools have become more widely available, they have increasingly been incorporated into scamming and other types of cybercrime around the world. In the last two years, officials working for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime have identified more than 10 face-swapping tools potentially being used by cybercriminals in Southeast Asia, including for cryptocurrency scams and police officer impersonation.\n\nHaotian has a website for its face-swapping tool, but it primarily promotes its desktop app via a public Telegram channel, which launched in October 2023 according to Ngo’s research. Through this channel, which now has more than 20,000 subscribers, the company markets new versions of the app, gives development updates, and offers technical support. While marketing software through Telegram isn’t inherently nefarious, researchers say that Haotian’s customer base has increasingly skewed toward scammers who already seek out information about an array of gray market services on the messaging app.\n\nTelegram declined to comment. However, after WIRED got in touch with the company, the main public Haotian Telegram channel and some associated accounts became inaccessible or appeared to have been deleted. Telegram did not return a request for comment on whether the company took these accounts down.",

        "title": "NASA just caught a rare glimpse of an interstellar comet",
        "summary": "An instrument aboard NASA’s Europa Clipper spacecraft captured rare ultraviolet observations of an interstellar comet while Earth-based telescopes were blinded by the Sun. The spacecraft’s unique position provided an unprecedented look at the comet’s dust and plasma tails from an unusual angle. Scientists detected hydrogen, oxygen, and signs of intense gas release, hinting at powerful activity after the comet’s closest approach to the Sun. The findings may reveal clues about how comets form arou",
        "content": "NASA's Europa Clipper spacecraft has captured important new data on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS using its Southwest Research Institute-led Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS). In July, 3I/ATLAS became the third officially confirmed interstellar object known to enter our solar system. The UVS instrument was able to observe the comet during a window when viewing from Mars and Earth was difficult or not possible.\n\n\"We're excited that this opportunity to view another target on the way to Jupiter was completely unexpected,\" said SwRI's Dr. Kurt Retherford, the principal investigator for Europa-UVS. \"Our observations have allowed for a unique and nuanced view of the comet.\"\n\nEuropa Clipper launched in 2024 and is expected to reach the Jovian system in 2030. Once there, it will orbit Jupiter and carry out 49 close flybys of the moon Europa. UVS collects ultraviolet light to study the makeup of Europa's atmospheric gases and materials on its icy surface.\n\nTiming matters when telescopes cannot see\n\nLess than a week after the comet was discovered, analysts at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) mapped its path through the solar system. The Europa Clipper team soon recognized that the spacecraft could watch 3I/ATLAS in November, a period when the comet's position near the Sun would block much of the view from Earth and when Mars-based observing conditions were no longer at their best.\n\nThat timing let Europa Clipper fill a critical gap, connecting Mars-based observations from late September with later viewing opportunities from Earth. Because the comet's trajectory placed it between Europa Clipper and the Sun, the spacecraft had an unusual vantage point. This matters because comets typically show two main tails, a dust tail that trails behind and a plasma tail that points away from the Sun.\n\nA behind-the-tails view and a second spacecraft perspective\n\nFrom its sunward location, Europa-UVS captured a downstream view of both tails, looking largely from \"behind\" the tails back toward the comet's nucleus and coma (cloud of gas surrounding it). At the same time, observations from the SwRI-led UVS instrument aboard ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will add an anti-sunward view, giving scientists a more typical angle during the exact same period.\n\n\"We're hopeful that this new view, along with observations from Earth-based assets and other spacecraft, will help us to piece together a more complete understanding of the tails' geometries,\" said SwRI's Dr. Thomas Greathouse, co-deputy principal investigator of Europa-UVS.\n\nEuropa-UVS identified oxygen, hydrogen, and dust-related signatures. These findings support the broader set of observations indicating that 3I/ATLAS went through a stretch of high outgassing activity shortly after its closest approach to the Sun.\n\n\"Europa-UVS is particularly adept at measuring fundamental transitions from atoms and molecules,\" Retherford said. \"We can see gases come off the comet, and water molecules break apart into hydrogen and oxygen atoms.\"\n\nThose measurements allow Europa Clipper to closely study these atomic species, offering a more detailed look at what is happening in the comet and what it is made of.\n\nClues to the comet's origin beyond our solar system\n\n\"Understanding the composition of the comet and how readily these gases are emitted can give us a clearer view of the comet's origin and how it may have evolved during transit from elsewhere in the galaxy to our solar system,\" SwRI's Dr. Tracy Becker, co-deputy principal investigator of Europa-UVS said. \"What are the chemical processes at play, and how can we unravel the comet's origin in its own star system? Were those processes similar to how we believe our solar system formed? Those are big questions.\"\n\nJPL manages the Europa Clipper mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, D.C. The mission was developed in partnership with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), in Laurel, Maryland.",

        "title": "Elon Musk’s $56B Tesla pay package restored by Delaware Supreme Court",
        "summary": "The decision brings to a close a years-long court battle that irked Musk so much he moved Tesla's incorporation from Delaware to Texas.",
        "content": "The Delaware Supreme Court has reinstated Elon Musk’s $56 billion Tesla pay package from 2018, overturning last year’s ruling by the state’s Chancery Court, according to an opinion published Friday.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling, the judges on the highest court in Delaware said that canceling Musk’s package left him “uncompensated for his time and efforts over a period of six years.” Adjusted for Tesla’s current stock price, which hit all-time highs this week, the reinstated package would be worth around $140 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe state supreme court’s decision likely draws to a close a years-long battle that left such a bad taste in Musk’s mouth that he moved Tesla’s incorporation from Delaware to Texas, which prompted other companies to follow suit.\n\n“Vindicated,” Musk posted to X on Friday in response to the news. “Thank you for your unwavering support,” he replied to Alexandra Merz, a vocal shareholder known as “TeslaBoomerMama.”\n\nTesla will now likely revoke a $29 billion pay package it offered Musk earlier this year, which was meant as a hedge against the possibility that the company could lose the Delaware Supreme Court appeal. The $1 trillion compensation package awarded to Musk in November is separate from that, and will continue to exist going forward, giving Musk a series of lofty goals to hit in order to unlock the full value.\n\nThe 2018 award also set out a number of milestones that Musk had to hit in order to unlock the full value. Musk and Tesla hit all of those goals, but not before a shareholder filed suit over the award in 2018, arguing that it had been improperly negotiated and that shareholders weren’t properly informed of the conflicts of interest at play.\n\nMusk and the many Tesla supporters decried the lawsuit as absurd, particularly the fact that the plaintiff — a former corporate defense lawyer and heavy metal drummer named Richard Tornetta — only owned nine shares of company stock.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nAfter years of back-and-forth, including a trial where Musk testified, the Chancery Court judge overseeing the case agreed with the plaintiff and initially struck down the pay package in January 2024. Tesla held a vote at its annual meeting in 2024 where shareholders “re-approved” the package, but the judge confirmed her decision in December 2024. Tesla appealed soon after.",

        "content": "This is the result of letting my camera take photos continuously for 3 hours, capturing the apparent movement of the stars due to Earth's rotation. When facing north the stars appear to be circling around the North Star.\n\nPerched high in the White Mountains of Eastern California, this gnarled bristlecone pine stands as a testament to resilience at an elevation exceeding 10,000 feet (3,200 meters). These remarkable trees hold the record for the oldest living non-clonal organisms on Earth, with some individuals dating back nearly 5,000 years — contemporary with the construction of the Egyptian pyramids.\n\nThe environment that nurtures these ancient sentinels is unforgivingly harsh. Bitter cold, fleeting summers, relentless winds, and nutrient-poor soil would seem to promise certain death for most living things. Paradoxically, these extreme conditions are precisely why bristlecone pines not only survive but flourish. Their incredibly slow growth results in wood so dense and robust that it becomes virtually impervious to insects, disease, and the erosive forces that would destroy less tenacious organisms.\n\nEach twisted branch and weathered surface of this tree tells a story of survival, a living chronicle of endurance that spans millennia, defying the most challenging environmental conditions imaginable.\n\nAcquisition details: blend of 35 exposures: 5 mins, 24mm, f/8, ISO 100\n\nFinally if you read all the way to end, thanks!

        "summary": "The round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to people familiar with the deal.",
        "content": "Resolve AI, a startup developing an autonomous site reliability engineer (SRE), a tool that automatically maintains software systems, has raised a Series A led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, according to three people familiar with the deal.\n\nThe headline valuation for the fresh round is $1 billion, sources said. However, the company’s actual blended valuation was lower because of a multi-tranched structure. In this setup, investors purchased some equity at a $1 billion valuation but acquired the remainder — likely a larger percentage of the round — at a lower price. This novel investment approach has recently become popular for the most sought-after AI startups, investors say.\n\nThe startup’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approximately $4 million, two of the people said. The size of the funding round couldn’t be learned.\n\nResolve AI and Lightspeed didn’t respond to our request for comment.\n\nFounded less than two years ago, the startup is led by former Splunk executive Spiros Xanthos and Mayank Agarwal, Splunk’s former chief architect for observability. The duo’s partnership dates back 20 years to their graduate studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This isn’t their first collaboration; they previously co-founded Omnition, a startup that was acquired by Splunk in 2019.\n\nWhile human SREs are traditionally responsible for manually troubleshooting and resolving system failures, Resolve AI automates this process by autonomously identifying, diagnosing, and resolving production issues in real time.\n\nThe automation addresses a growing challenge for companies. As software systems become more complex and distributed across cloud infrastructure, outfits often struggle to find and retain enough skilled SREs to keep systems running smoothly. Automating these tasks can reduce downtime, lower operational costs, and free up engineering teams to focus on building new features rather than trying to constantly stomp out production issues.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

        "content": "George joins Prince William in preparing meal for homeless\n\n6 hours ago Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save\n\nAndrew Parsons/Kensington Palace Prince George helped prepare Yorkshire puddings on his first visit to the Passage\n\nThe Prince of Wales has brought his 12-year-old son Prince George to help at a homeless shelter, so he can teach him about homelessness and show him the efforts of organisations trying to tackle it. Prince William took his son to a charity with a deep personal connection - the Passage, in Westminster - where William had been brought as a child by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales. This handing on of the torch took place last week, with George helping to make lunch for people being supported by the Passage, which works with homeless people in central London. Prince George signed a visitors' book using the same page signed by William and his grandmother Diana in December 1993.\n\nWatch: Prince William and his son Prince George on their visit to the Passage\n\nMick Clarke, chief executive of the Passage, said Prince George had come when they were preparing Christmas lunch for 150 people. \"So it was really about, 'Are you ready to roll up your sleeves and get stuck in?' And he very much was,\" said Mr Clarke. \"Very much like his dad, actually - just wanted to get stuck in and help,\" said the charity chief. \"A lovely kid is how I would describe him, and he just really seemed very interested in the work that we do and particularly in talking to people who have used our services,\" said Mr Clarke. There was some competition between father and son in getting the food ready. \"William was on the sprouts, getting his sprouts ready so they could go into the steamer, and Prince George was helping with the Yorkshire puddings,\" said Mr Clarke. He described the signing of the book with Princess Diana's name as a \"lovely, beautiful moment - I think particularly with Prince William pointing out to George, 'This is my mum's signature. This was the first time that she brought me here.' \"It kind of felt full circle, really - 1993 through to 2025, with William bringing George,\" said Mr Clarke. The charity head said it seemed as though Prince George's family were trying to show their children life outside the palace and how it was important that \"the most vulnerable in society are supported and looked after\". And in terms of contrasts, the visit to the homelessness charity came on the same day as the annual Royal Family Christmas lunch in Buckingham Palace.\n\nTHE PASSAGE Prince William first visited the Passage with his mother Princess Diana when aged 11\n\nAndrew Parsons/Kensington Palace Thirty-two years on, Prince William and Prince George help set the table for the charity's Christmas lunch\n\nPrince William has been a supporter of the Passage since he was brought as an 11 year old by his mother, who had made regular visits, both public and private. William is running his own campaign to tackle homelessness, Homewards, and he has described his early experience of visiting the Passage as an inspiration. He remembered being anxious about his first visit with Princess Diana, but finding an unexpected warmth and happiness. \"My mother went about her usual part of making everyone feel relaxed, and having a laugh and joking with everyone,\" he said in an interview last year. \"I remember at the time, kind of thinking, well, if everyone's not got a home, they're all going to be really sad. \"But it was incredible how happy an environment it was,\" recalled Prince William.\n\nAndrew Parsons/Kensington Palace Prince George signed the visitors' book more than 30 years after his father and grandmother\n\nTHE PASSAGE A young William playing chess at the Westminster-based charity",

        "summary": "In the Jordan valley, teenage settlers drive herds of goats into a Palestinian community in a bid to force families out – volunteers are trying to hold the line",
        "content": "It is a daily onslaught. Every morning, teenage Israeli settlers drive a herd of goats from their outpost in the hills down into the valley towards the Palestinian village of Ras Ein al-Auja.\n\nThe local men, women and children retreat inside their huts and tents. Any hint of resistance from a Palestinian is likely to bring in the Israeli army or the border police, confiscation of property and disappearance into the maw of “administrative” detention without trial, for months or years.\n\nInstead, a small group of volunteers step forward each morning to face the descending settlers whose stated aim is to overrun and trample the village with their livestock, and drive Palestinians out.\n\nOn this particular Saturday, the defenders of Ras Ein al-Auja are four Israeli Jews, a Hungarian and an American, who make a screen around Palestinian homes to shoo away the encroaching animals.\n\n“The settlers are trying to provoke the local people into protecting themselves, but if they do the army and police will storm the community and arrest everyone,” said one of the Israeli volunteers, Amir Pansky, a retired Israeli army major.\n\n“We are a protective presence because we are putting our bodies between the Jewish settlers and the Palestinians.”\n\nFor every defensive move they make, the teenage settler goatherds respond with an offensive counter-move to outflank the village guardians. The boys walk right up to the volunteers until their faces are inches apart, and the latter try to stand their ground, waving their arms and shouting.\n\nView image in fullscreen Part of a flock that belongs to Jewish settlers. Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian\n\nThe goatherds hold up their phones to record the scene, and give a running commentary, while each defender wears a body-cam, an insurance policy against any false claims of assault.\n\nIt is a tense battle of wits. Chess, but played with goats. Just when the face-off is at its peak, the settlers in the outpost half a kilometre uphill unleash a surprise move – driving a herd of about 50 camels down towards the other end of the village, like a cavalry charge ordered by some unseen hilltop Napoleon, forcing the defenders to split up to confront the new threat.\n\nFor all its outward absurdities, the game is played in deadly earnest. The goatherd boys carry sticks and clubs and have shown themselves ready to use them in tussles with volunteer defenders.\n\nThere are older settlers waiting in the wings with other weapons. On 3 December, assailants on all-terrain vehicles raided the compound where international volunteers stay in Ras Ein al-Auja, and aimed pepper spray in the face of several of them.\n\nOn the day of the camel charge, a man with a light brown uniform and assault rifle slung around his shoulder arrived at the scene in a white pickup truck and walked alongside the goatherd boys in a show of support.\n\nIsraeli activists identified the newcomer as Gabriel Kalish, the local security coordinator from Me’vo’ot Yericho, about 9km farther down the Jordan valley.\n\nKalish refused to give an interview to the Guardian, suggesting that he happened to be passing by. However he added: “This land belongs to the Jews.” Activists have photographed him many times, in a variety of different uniforms, at the site of settler incursions on Palestinian villages.\n\nAs a security coordinator in a settlement, Kalish’s wages and gun are paid for by the government, and his presence at the daily campaign of intimidation against Palestinians is a link between the teenagers herding goats and camels and the extremists currently in cabinet positions, who are bent on the annexation of the West Bank.\n\nLev Taor, a young settler whose turn it was a few days earlier to drive a goat herd through Ras Ein al-Auja, made no secret of the overall objective.\n\n“I came with my flock to protect the land. The goal is to expel these people,” Taor said, referring to the local Palestinians.\n\nThe lives of the people of Ras Ein al-Auja have been increasingly hemmed in over recent years. They can no longer graze their herds on the western slopes of the Jordan valley, as previous generations had done.\n\nSince the beginning of the Gaza war, and the radical acceleration of an Israeli land grab across the West Bank, the 700 local people have largely been confined to the village, a string of huts, tents and animal shelters along a creek running east from a spring towards the River Jordan. They have cut down their flocks and bought feed for them, but refused so far to give up Ras Ein al-Auja altogether.\n\n“It was very quiet here before. You could graze your flock east, west, north, south and there was no problem,” Naef Ja’alin, one of the villagers, said. “The settlers started harassing us years ago, when we were grazing our flock, but that was some distance from the village. But since 7 October [2023], they have come closer and closer, to the point that today nobody takes their herd outside the village.”\n\nHe said his son slept in his shoes so ",

        "content": "When the holistic practitioner Emma Cardinal, 32, became pregnant in May 2023, she planned to have a home birth with midwives. Cardinal lives in a town in British Columbia with strong counter-cultural roots. “The community that I live in, home birth is something a lot of women prioritise,” she explains.\n\nThen Cardinal stumbled across a podcast from the Free Birth Society (FBS). One episode in particular, she says, made an impact: “Unpacking Ultrasound With Yolande Clark.” In it, the Canadian ex-doula Yolande Norris-Clark falsely links ultrasounds to autism and ADHD and states that “ultrasound damages and modifies and destroys cells”.\n\nView image in fullscreen Yolande Norris-Clark in an episode of The Complete Guide to Freebirth. Photograph: FBS\n\nNorris-Clark, who was born in Vancouver, is arguably the most famous freebirth influencer in the world. She is also a key figure in FBS, a US company run by her business partner and fellow ex-doula Emilee Saldaya.\n\nFBS, which promotes an extreme version of free birth in which women abandon any form of prenatal care and give birth without doctors or midwives present, is estimated to have generated more than $13m in revenues since 2018. A recent Guardian investigation identified 48 cases of late-term stillbirths or neonatal deaths or other forms of serious harm involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS.\n\nThe intellectual heft behind FBS, Norris-Clark shaped the organisation’s radical position on birth, while Saldaya, its founder, runs the business. Most women find FBS through its Instagram account, which has 132,000 followers, or podcast, which has been downloaded 5m times.\n\nBut Norris-Clark is a significant social media influencer in her own right, pioneering a radical version of free birth that concerns even pro-freebirth advocates.\n\nView image in fullscreen Emma Cardinal: ‘You can’t just post about the good side of free birth. What happens when it goes very wrong?’ Photograph: Annika Faith\n\nAfter listening to the podcast about ultrasounds, Cardinal was alarmed. “I was petrified of miscarriage and stillbirth,” she says, explaining that her younger brother was stillborn. “There’s not a chance I’m risking that.” Cardinal came to believe ultrasounds “aren’t super safe for the baby”.\n\nAt that stage, Cardinal had not yet decided to freebirth. She phoned a local midwifery practice and explained that she wanted a home birth, but did not want to have any ultrasounds during her pregnancy. But the receptionist, Cardinal recalls, said that if she wanted to give birth with them, ultrasounds were non-negotiable. Cardinal thought about it, and decided she was not comfortable proceeding.\n\nInstead, after listening to about 100 episodes of the FBS podcast, Cardinal decided to freebirth. In one journal entry, she wrote: “I know it in my bones that freebirthing is my safest and most liberated option.” She purchased FBS’s popular video course, “The Complete Guide to Freebirth”.\n\nCardinal’s son Floyd was stillborn in March 2024. During labour Cardinal saw meconium in her waters, a possible sign of distress, but dismissed it because “I was told by FBS that meconium is totally normal”. She stayed home for three days, because “I remember hearing Emilee Saldaya’s voice in my head [from the podcasts], saying: ‘I wouldn’t be concerned for the first three days.’”\n\nAfter Floyd died, Cardinal was hospitalised with sepsis and placed in an induced coma. She has had a number of surgeries to repair the damage from his birth, and had to wear an ostomy bag for a time. “I didn’t think that could even be a reality that could happen after birth,” she says. “I almost had to have a hysterectomy.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Emma Cardinal in hospital after her first ostomy surgery, nine months after the stillbirth of Floyd. Photograph: Annika Faith\n\nLooking back, Cardinal believes that much of the information she received from FBS was “incomplete, biased, one-sided and kind of dogmatic”. This includes the information she received on ultrasounds, which are not harmful to unborn babies when used appropriately. She adds: “You can’t just post about the good side of free birth. What happens when it goes very wrong?”\n\nNorris-Clark has not responded to repeated requests for comment about the Guardian’s investigation, which is told through The Birth Keepers podcast series. She has previously defended her partnership with Saldaya, saying FBS is “the most ethical kind of business you can run”. Critics of FBS, she has said, fail to understand the commitment to women taking “radical responsibility” for their births. And she has said it is unfair to hold her responsible for the choices of a mother who consumes her content.\n\nHowever the spotlight on tragedies involving mothers around the world who consumed FBS content is posing a crisis for the business.\n\nSaldaya has also not provided a substantive response to requests for comment, but told the Guardian in one email that “some of these allegation",

        "content": "Mostrar comentarios 0\n\nEl Madrid volvió a ganar. Y Xabi volvió a perder. El resultado dice que los blancos sumar tres puntos ante el Sevilla, pero el juego insiste en contar la historia de un equipo que no solo no mejora, sino que parece ir en una involución constante. Tras el mal partido en Talavera, lejos de mostrar una mejoría, el Madrid ofreció en el Bernabéu uno de los partidos más pobres de la temporada. Espeso con balón, frágil sin él y sin apenas continuidad en el juego. El Sevilla encontró demasiadas facilidades para competir un partido que el Madrid nunca controló de verdad. Los pitos de la afición empiezan a formar parte del paisaje del estadio.\n\nEl triunfo madridista ya no maquilla un rendimiento preocupante. Xabi suma tres victorias seguidas y veremos si eso le permite ganar tiempo, porque la cara de Florentino cuando le enfocaron las cámaras no augura nada bueno. Contento no estaba. Lógico. Porque la imagen del Madrid ante un Sevilla con 10 fue paupérrima. Ni el 2-0 final ni el récord de Mbappé alcanzan para disipar las dudas.\n\nAlexis siempre deja cositas\n\nUn veterano de guerra, Alexis Sánchez, puso en aprietos al Real Madrid durante todo el encuentro. Porque tal fue su partido que Almeyda le dejó durante los 90 mnutos. El chileno compensa su falta de físico con un conocimiento del juego que le permite poner en jaque a cualquier defensa. Sufrieron de lo lindo Huijsen y Rüdiger con él, indetectable jugando entre líneas. Estuvo a punto de marcar un golazo espectacular de chilena tras una maniobra en el área en el que dejó un gran control con el exterior.\n\nIsaac Romero perdió una oportunidad histórica\n\nEl delantero del Sevilla pudo abandonar el Bernabéu con el balón del partido lleno de las firmas de sus compañeros, pero se marchó de vacío. Isaac fue Mbappé en el desmarque, encontrando siempre el carril libre a las espaldas de Huijsen y Rüdiger, pero falló en el remate. Buscó siempre la definición más lógica ante el gigante Courtois, pero el belga le ganó la batalla. La noche en la que pudo salir a hombros del Bernabéu.\n\nLa presión del Madrid es para llorar\n\nLa presión del Madrid es un despropósito. Los jugadores llegan tarde, mal y nunca a la vez. Cada intento de robar arriba parece un plan improvisado, sin coordinación ni sentido colectivo, con líneas estiradas y esfuerzos aislados que solo sirven para abrir más espacios. El Sevilla superó la primera línea con una facilidad alarmante, porque cuando uno salta, el resto mira y duda. Y así una y otra vez.\n\nEn este contexto, Güler y Tchouaméni quedaron expuestos continuamente, sufriendo sin balón, obligados a tapar agujeros de manera constante, llegando tarde y mal perfilados de manera habitual. Camavinga entró al rescate en el 70' y supuestamente en un contexto más amable, ante un Sevilla ya con diez jugadores, pero el panorama siguió siendo el mismo.\n\nHuijsen no está bien\n\nEl central de la Selección está a años luz del jugador que impresionó en el Mundial de Clubes. Superado en cada duelo con Alexis e Isaac Romero, tampoco da muestras de solvencia con el balón en los pies. El jugador destinado a iniciar el juego del Madrid se muestra impreciso y da la sensación de sentirse superado con la situación que atraviesa el equipo. Castigado por las lesiones, Huijsen es ahora mismo otra víctima del mal momento del equipo.\n\nPitos a Vinicius, al juego del equipo...\n\nLos pitos de la afición se han instalado en el Bernabéu. Vinicius, que no jugó un buen partido, fue un día más el objetivo del público. El brasileño se llevó una buena pitada cuando fue sustituido y quedó demostrado una vez más que no cae en gracia a un amplísimo sector del Bernabéu.\n\nEl juego del equipo también se llevó lo suyo. La afición empieza a perder la paciencia con un equipo que, insistimos, va de mal en peor.",

        "content": "The US struck multiple targets in Syria on Friday that the US military tied to ISIS as retaliation for the recent attack that killed two American service members there, according to two US officials.\n\n“I am hereby announcing that the United States is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible,” President Donald Trump later wrote on Truth Social.\n\nRoughly 70 targets were hit in the operation, the two US officials said.\n\nDubbed “Operation Hawkeye,” a reference to the fact that the two US soldiers killed were from the “Hawkeye State” of Iowa, the strikes hit dozens of targets the military connected to ISIS — including infrastructure and weapons storage sites across Syria, one of the officials said.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the strikes a “declaration of vengeance,” in a post on X late Friday afternoon.\n\n“This is not the beginning of a war — it is a declaration of vengeance,” he wrote. “The United States of America, under President Trump’s leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people.”\n\nAfter the attack on December 13 that killed the two soldiers and a civilian interpreter, US and partner forces conducted 10 operations resulting in the death or detention of around 23 people, that official added. Those operations also yielded intelligence from electronics gathered during the operations that provided information contributing to targeting for the strikes, according to the same US official.\n\nHundreds of American troops continue to be deployed to Syria as part of the US’ longstanding mission to combat ISIS, a mission that began when ISIS rapidly took control of a large chunk of Syria and Iraq in the mid 2010s. Subsequently, US and partner operations, paired with a change in regime in Syria, largely eliminated that territorial control.\n\nThe goal of Operation Hawkeye is to deliver a big blow to ISIS remnants in Syria and their ability to pose a threat to US forces in the region, the same official told CNN.\n\nPartner nations, including Jordan, joined the US in the strikes, the official said.\n\nThe Jordanian Armed Forces confirmed its participation in the strikes on Saturday, saying it did so to prevent extremist organizations threatening the security of Syria’s neighbors “especially after the ISIS terrorist organization reconstituted itself and rebuilt its capabilities in southern Syria.”\n\nTrump said on Friday that the US is “striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated.”\n\n“The Government of Syria, led by a man who is working very hard to bring Greatness back to Syria, and is fully in support,” he added.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has vowed retaliation against ISIS in the wake of the December 13 attack, CNN has reported that Syria’s Ministry of Interior Affairs said the attacker had been a part of Syria’s Internal Security service. US and Syrian officials acknowledged to CNN that the gunman’s ties to ISIS are not entirely clear-cut; ISIS has not claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe two US service members killed in Syria were identified this week as Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, 29, of Marshalltown, Iowa. They were killed while engaging hostile forces in Palmyra, Syria, the US Army said. Both soldiers were assigned to the Iowa National Guard’s 1st Squadron, 113th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division.\n\nThree additional Iowa National Guard members were wounded in the attack and evacuated for further medical treatment.\n\n“Our priority right now is supporting the families of our fallen and wounded soldiers,” Maj. Gen. Stephen Osborne, adjutant general of the Iowa National Guard, previously said in a statement. “The entire Iowa National Guard grieves for this terrible loss, and we stand together to support the soldiers and their families.”\n\nRoughly 1,800 Iowa National Guard soldiers began deploying to the Middle East earlier this year as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, a release from Gov. Kim Reynold’s office said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu at the Assemblée Nationale in Paris on December 17, 2025. JULIEN MUGUET / HANS LUCAS\n\nFrench Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu had intended to dedicate Friday, December 19, to urgent issues in the agricultural sector and meetings with union representatives. Yet, the turmoil of the budget debate once again upended priorities.\n\nThe two lead budget rapporteurs, Jean-François Husson and Philippe Juvin (Les Républicains, right wing), arrived at the prime minister's residence looking serious before journalists on Friday, shortly before 10 am. Just one hour after the start of a joint committee bringing together seven senators and seven MPs, they acknowledged the failure of negotiations on the 2026 budget bill. \"We were ready for a compromise, but there was no guarantee that the bill would receive a positive vote from both the Assemblée Nationale and the Sénat,\" said Philippe Juvin, Les Républicains MP.\n\nThe announcement carried heavy consequences: For the second year in a row, the government would fail to provide France with a budget within the timeframe required by the Constitution. Parliamentary discussions would continue beyond December 31, forcing the government to rely on a special law to ensure continuity of the state.\n\nYou have 86.22% of this article left to read.

Und vieles mehr.\n\nDer tagestipp : Die automatische Massage\n\nInvoSpa Shiatsu Rücken-, Schulter- und Nackenmassagegerät mit Wärme, Deep Tissue Zum Angebot Affiliate Info\n\nDieses Shiatsu-Nackenmassagegerät gehört zu den Geschenken, die wahrscheinlich wirklich genutzt werden: Es knetet Schultern und Nacken durch, soll Verspannungen lösen und mit zuschaltbarer Wärme echte Entspannung nach langen Tagen bringen. Im Kaufberater-Labor getestet haben wir es noch nicht – und auf die Kunden-Rezensionen geben wir erfahrungsgemäß nicht allzu viel (man weiß nie, wer sie geschrieben hat). Daher gilt: Taugt es – behalten! Taugt es nichts: skrupellos Retoure! Die ist in diesem Fall 30 Tage oder bis spätestens 31. Januar möglich. Bis dahin sollte man sich ein Urteil gebildet haben können. Was wir jetzt schon sagen können: Der Preis ist gut. Anderswo zahlen Sie fast das Doppelte!\n\nder Tipp für Praktiker : Das Nervenspar-Gadget\n\nBIIB Teleskopmagnet Werkzeug Zum Angebot Affiliate Info\n\nRuntergefallen, verschwunden, unerreichbar – genau dafür ist dieses Tool da. Der ausziehbare Magnet mit LED holt Schrauben, Muttern, Bits und alle Gegenstände, die Eisen enthalten, aus dunklen, engen Ecken, ohne Bücken, Fummeln, Fluchen oder Taschenlampe im Mund. Kein Spielzeug, sondern ein kleines Helferlein für Garage, Haushalt und Werkbank. Streichpreise sind meistens Quatsch, hier kostete das Teil wirklich bis vor Kurzem so viel.\n\nDer Tipp für Mobile : Puma-Tasche noch bis Mitternacht\n\nPUMA Teamgoal 23 Sporttasche Zum Angebot Affiliate Info\n\n„Eine Sporttasche in Schwarz für nur 15,17 Euro kann doch nur Murks sein, oder?“, formulierte der BILD-Sparfochs in seinem gestrigen Artikel – und gab selbst die Antwort: „Es sei denn, es ist ein Kampfpreis bei Amazon. Und die Tasche ist von Puma. Das sind gleich zwei Argumente, zuzuschlagen. Denn nicht nur Sportkram, auch Weihnachtsgeschenke müssen ja transportiert werden. Im Netz kostet die Tasche sonst mindestens das Doppelte. Hier verliere ich nicht viele Worte: rein in den Warenkorb damit!“ Noch bis Mitternacht ist das Angebot gültig.\n\nder Tipp für Elektrische : E-Scooter zum Sparpreis\n\nXiaomi E-Scooter 5 Pro Zum Angebot Affiliate Info\n\nManche schenken Socken. Andere gleich Bewegungsfreiheit. Der Xiaomi Electric Scooter 5 Pro ist genau die Art Weihnachtsgeschenk, bei der kurz Stille herrscht – und dann sofort der Haustürschlüssel gesucht wird. Straßenzulassung in Deutschland ist jedenfalls vorhanden. Auch im Test des BILD-Kaufberaters durch unsere Kollegin Daniela Leistikow konnte der 5 Pro überzeugen: mit guter Federung, spritziger Beschleunigung und einem anständigen Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Die Ladezeit betrug im Test von 0 auf 100 Prozent rund 8 Stunden – am besten also nachts aufladen, wenn täglicher Bedarf vorhanden. Amazon wartet aktuell mit dem Bestpreis auf – Decathlon, Otto und MediaMarkt folgen mit Sicherheitsabstand. Und laut den Liefer-Angaben kommt das Ding sogar noch vor Weihnachten an.\n\nder Tipp für Erleuchtete : Nackenlampe\n\nGlocusent Leselampe Zum Angebot Affiliate Info\n\nEs gibt Produkte, die weiß man erst zu schätzen, wenn man sie hat. Diese Leselampe könnte so eines sein. Um den Nacken gehängt, bringen kleine LEDs das Licht direkt dorthin, wo Sie es brauchen – etwa auf ein Buch (endlich ohne den Partner zu stören!), die Stricknadeln oder Reparaturen. Aktuell wandert die Lampe besonders oft in den Warenkorb, denn der Preis stimmt: Günstiger gab es das Produkt seit September nicht mehr bei Amazon. Woanders, u.a. bei Ebay, ist es klar teurer. Den angegebenen Streichpreis hat man praktisch nie bezahlt – wie meistens üblich. Dennoch ist der aktuelle (reale) Rabatt stattlich.\n\nder Tipp für Familien : App-gesteuertes Brettspiel\n\nOUTSMARTED! Outsmarted Ultimate Zum Angebot Affiliate Info\n\nEs muss nicht immer „Mensch ärgere dich nicht“ sein: Zehntausende Familien haben sich in diesem Advent für das App-gesteuerte Brettspiel „Outsmarted“ entschieden. Ob das Spaß macht? Wissen wir (noch) nicht! Was wir wissen: Der Preis bei Amazon für die „Ultimate Edition“ ist gut. Bei Ebay zahlt man aktuell 20 Euro mehr.\n\nder Tipp für Sichere : Smartes Türschloss\n\nNuki Smart Lock Pro (5. Gen) + Keypad 2.0 Zum Angebot Affiliate Info\n\nLängst keine Nischenprodukte mehr sind smarte Türschlösser – und dieses hier ist sogar der Testsieger im BILD-Kaufberater, der 16 Schlösser akribisch prüfte. Das Angebot, das wir aufgestöbert haben, bietet eine gute Gesamtersparnis im Vergleich zu Einzelpreisen (rund 66 Euro). Interessiert? In unserem Testbericht erfahren Sie mehr über Smartlocks.\n\nHaben",

        "content": "Ein Polizeifoto von Jeffrey Epstein: Der Sexualstraftäter wurde am 10. August 2019 tot in seiner Gefängniszelle gefunden\n\nSeine Köder waren vielfältig, das Ziel seiner Angel immer dasselbe: Er warf sie mitten in die Träume minderjähriger Teenager und junger Frauen aus. Bissen sie an und hatte er sie dann am Haken, gab es für sie meist kein Entkommen mehr.\n\nAuch zwei Hamburger Schwestern sollten Jeffrey Epstein (†66) eigentlich ins Netz gehen, wie der „Spiegel“ und das ZDF in einer gemeinsamen Recherche veröffentlichen. Sophie und Lea Hellingsen (ihre Namen wurden vom „Spiegel“ geändert) waren damals 18 und 16 Jahre alt. Es war im Sommer 2006, die beiden trafen in einem Café in New York auf eine Frau, die sie auf ihren tollen „europäischen Look“ ansprach. Ob sie sich nicht bei der Modelagentur, für die sie arbeite, vorstellen wollten. Die Frau überreicht ihnen eine Visitenkarte, auf der nur eine Telefonnummer und der Name Jeffrey Epstein standen.\n\nIn diesem Gebäude lebte Jeffrey Epstein, wenn er in New York war\n\nDer Köder war gelegt, Sophie und Lea bissen an. Zwar besprachen sie sich mit ihren Eltern, aber vor knapp 20 Jahren war das Internet noch nicht so ausgelegt, dass jedes Detail über einen Menschen dort zu finden gewesen wäre. So wussten die Eltern nur von Epstein, dem angesehenen Geschäftsmann, zu berichten.\n\nAuch interessant Anzeige Auch interessant Anzeige\n\nZwei Stunden dauerte das Gespräch. Die Schwestern erinnern sich noch genau an einen ausgestopften Tiger und einen ausgestopften Hund. Und dann noch daran, wie freundlich und professionell Epstein war. Dass ihm Anteile des Dessous-Labels Victoria’s Secret gehören würden. Er lässt die Schwestern in seinem Büro „laufen“ und verspricht ihnen danach, dass er sie platzieren würde.\n\nBei diesem ersten Treffen gab es nichts von dem widerlichen Verhalten, das die Welt jetzt von Jeffrey Epstein kennt. Kein Anfassen, keine Massagen, nichts von alledem. „Hätten wir auch nicht gemacht“, zitiert der „Spiegel“ Sophie Hellingsen, „no way“.\n\nEin ausgestopfter Hund. Es könnte der sein, den auch die Hamburger Schwestern gesehen haben\n\nWährend andere Mädchen von ihm abhängig wurden, Geld und andere Vergütungen gegen sexuelle Gefügigkeiten erhielten, konnte er Sophie und Lea nicht in seine Abhängigkeit treiben. Warum? Das können sie im Nachhinein auch nicht mehr so richtig beantworten. Die beiden waren nicht auf Geld angewiesen und die ältere, Sophie, hatte da so ein Bauchgefühl, dass es mit einem Gespräch und ein paar Fotos nicht getan ist, um Modelkarriere zu machen.\n\nEins ist den beiden Frauen heute allerdings völlig klar: „Dass es auch ganz anders hätte ausgehen können.“",

        "content": "Despite ongoing fighting and horrific human rights violations, global attention on the world's worst humanitarian and displacement crises remains low. The situation in Kordofan is worsening.\n\nThe ongoing war in Sudan is the most neglected global crisis in 2025, a survey among 22 global aid organizations concluded this week. The war-torn country also ranked first in \"The top 10 crises the world can't ignore in 2026\" by the International Rescue Committee.\n\nThroughout 2025, the situation in the African country has continued to deteriorate since the war began in April 2023. At the time, the generals of the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, fell out over the integration of the paramilitary forces into the national army. Since then, oil- and gold-rich Sudan, with its vast agricultural lands, has turned into what the UN and other aid organizations call the world's largest humanitarian and displacement crises.\n\nAccording to the UN, some 14 million people remain displaced within Sudan and in neighboring countries.\n\nThe estimated death tally ranges between 40,000 and 250,000 people. More accurate or updated figures remain out of reach as fighting continues, satellite-based internet communication is curbed, and many aid organizations and observers have left the country.\n\n\"The Sudan crisis should be front page news every single day,\" Save the Children humanitarian director Abdurahman Sharif said in a statement.\n\nThe UN World Food Program (WFP) announced that they will cut support for civilians in Sudan to the bare minimum from January 2026 onwards Image: Zohra Bensemra/REUTERS\n\nNew hotspot: Kordofan\n\nFighting between the RSF and SAF meanwhile is concentrated on the region of Kordofan, where the Sudanese army holds control of several cities that are surrounded by the paramilitary RSF.\n\nKordofan is also the last region that separates army-held territories in the north and the center, including Sudan's capital Khartoum, and RSF-controlled areas in Sudan's western Darfur region and parts of the south.\n\n\"Most recently, violence in Kordofan has escalated dramatically,\" Jan Sebastian Friedrich-Rust, executive director of the German section of the NGO Action against Hunger, confirms.\n\n\"The siege of communities in Dilling and Kadugli [in South Kordofan] is blocking access to vital humanitarian aid,\" he told DW, explaining that people have nothing left to eat and there is no access to medicine.\n\n\"Famine has been already declared in [Darfur's] el-Fasher and Kadugli, and 20 other locations in Darfur and Kordofan are at acute risk of famine by January 2026,\" he said.\n\nThe dire situation is also reflected in the latest Sudan update by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). As of mid-December, the IPC estimated that 21.2 million people — nearly half of Sudan's population — face acute food insecurity.\n\nThis number is likely to increase given that the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) announced last Friday that from January onwards, it needs to reduce rations in Sudan to \"the absolute minimum for survival\" due to a lack of funding.\n\n\"If the world does not urgently step up, diplomatically, financially, and morally, an already catastrophic situation will deteriorate further with millions of Sudanese and their neighbors paying the price,\" Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN Refugee Agency's Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, warned in a statement this week.\n\nFighting in Kordofan has prompted several thousand people to flee while the remaining population is starving Image: REUTERS\n\nCivilians 'at the heart of warfare'\n\nAction Against Hunger's Friedrich-Rust also worries that Kordofan is about to turn into a second el-Fasher, where the RSF committed mass atrocities during their takeover in November.\n\nMeanwhile, Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), which uses satellite imagery to monitor atrocities, warned in a new report that the RSF militia \"destroyed and concealed evidence of its widespread mass killings.\"\n\n\n\nOf the 150 clusters of objects consistent with human remains the HRL had initially identified, nearly 60 are no longer visible. Instead, eight earth disturbances appeared near the sites of mass killing, the HRL said.\n\n\"The reality is that both parties to the conflict and their allies haven't just failed to protect civilians, but the targeting of civilians is at the heart of their warfare,\" Philippe Dam, Human Rights Watch's EU Director for Advocacy, told DW.\n\n\"Although the majority of sexual violence, attacks on hospitals, aid workers, and the use of explosive weapons in densely populated areas pertain to the responsibility of the RSF, also the SAF commits massive violations against civilians,\" he said.\n\nFor example, the SAF have stepped up mass detentions against those suspected of having collaborated or supported the RSF, Dam told DW on Thursday.\n\n\n\nThese detentions appear to be extremely arbitrary as those targeted also include humanitarian",

        "title": "Trump says US has launched large-scale attacks on ISIL in Syria",
        "summary": "The attacks come a week after three Americans, including two US soldiers, were killed in Syria’s Palmyra.",
        "content": "US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says attacks are ‘a declaration of vengeance’, and ‘lots’ of fighters have been killed.\n\nThe United States military “hit the ISIS [ISIL] thugs in Syria”, President Donald Trump has said, a week after two US soldiers and an interpreter were killed in Syria’s Palmyra city.\n\nIn a speech Friday evening in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, Trump said he “ordered a massive strike on the terrorists that killed our three great patriots last week”.\n\n“It was very successful. It was precision,” the president added. “We hit every site flawlessly and we are restoring peace through strength all over the world.”\n\nJordan’s ‍air force ‍also carried out strikes as part of the operation in southern Syria, the army confirmed Saturday.\n\nRami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told the AFP news agency that “at least five members” of ISIL were killed in eastern Syria’s Deir Az Zor province, including the leader of a cell responsible for drones in the area.\n\nA Syrian security source told AFP that the US strikes targeted ISIL cells in Syria’s vast Badia desert including in Homs, Deir Az Zor and Raqqa provinces, and did not include ground operations.\n\nTrump separately wrote on his Truth Social platform that Syria’s government, which was formed after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime in late 2024, was “fully in support” of the US military operation.\n\nSyria’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also repeated its commitment to combatting ISIL and said it “invites the United States and member states of the international coalition to support these efforts”.\n\n“The Syrian Arab Republic reiterates its steadfast commitment to fighting ISIS and ensuring that it has no safe havens on Syrian territory, and will continue to intensify military operations against it wherever it poses a threat,” the ministry said in the statement shared on X early on Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said earlier that US forces had targeted “ISIS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites”, adding that the attack was named Operation Hawkeye Strike.\n\n“This is not the beginning of a war — it is a declaration of vengeance,” Hegseth said in a post on social media. “Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue.”\n\nAl Jazeera’s Ayman Oghanna, reporting from Damascus, said the strikes hit central and northeastern parts of the country. Local sources in Palmyra and Raqqa told Al Jazeera they heard the sounds of fighter jets and huge explosions throughout the night.\n\nOne US official said the operation struck 70 targets holding ISIL infrastructure and weapons.\n\nUS deploys ‘fighter jets, attack helicopters, and artillery’\n\nThe US military’s Central Command (CENTCOM), which is responsible for operations in the Middle East, said it deployed “fighter jets, attack helicopters, and artillery” to launch “more than 100 precision munitions targeting known ISIS infrastructure and weapons sites”. It did not provide further details on the exact locations or casualties.\n\nCENTCOM said that “the Jordanian Armed Forces also supported with fighter aircraft”, a claim that the army backed in the day following the strikes.\n\nThe army participated “to prevent extremist organisations from exploiting these areas as launching pads to threaten the security of Syria’s neighbours”, it said in a statement.\n\nIn February 2015, ISIL burned a Royal Jordanian Air Force pilot alive in a cage in Syria after capturing him when his plane crashed a few months earlier. The gruesome killing – which was captured on video and claimed to be in response to Jordan’s role in the US-led coalition against ISIL – shocked Amman, which pledged that his “blood will not be shed in vain”.\n\nA Swedish man was eventually sentenced to life in prison in July of this year for his role in the pilot’s death.\n\nThis week’s operation came as Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa “is trying to rehabilitate his image and the image of Syria,” said Al Jazeera’s Oghanna.\n\nUS authorities considered al-Sharaa to be a “terrorist” as recently as last month, when the US Department of the Treasury removed him from the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list ahead of a meeting with Trump.\n\nAl-Sharaa “wants the world to know Syria is no longer safe haven for ISIL … and he’s also trying to transform his own image in the eyes of the world,” Oghanna said.\n\nThis latest episode, however, puts more pressure on the new Syrian government, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, the US and Jordan “to work more closely together in eradicating the ISIL threat”, Oghanna said.\n\nLast weekend, three Americans – two US National Guard members and a civilian interpreter – were killed in Palmyra by an attacker who targeted a convoy of US and Syrian forces before being shot dead, according to the US military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree US soldiers were also wounded in the attack. The US blamed that attack on ISIL and promised to retaliate.\n\nAbout 1,000 US soldier",

Und oft reichen schon kleine Wehwehchen – bis hin zum eingewachsenen Zehennagel.\n\nWas endgültig zum Aus bei der Bundeswehr führt – und wie man die Musterung garantiert nicht besteht – erfahren Sie nur mit BILDplus.",

        "title": "What scientists found inside Titan was not what anyone expected",
        "summary": "For years, scientists thought Saturn’s moon Titan hid a global ocean beneath its frozen surface. A new look at Cassini data now suggests something very different: a thick, slushy interior with pockets of liquid water rather than an open sea. A subtle delay in how Titan deforms under Saturn’s gravity revealed this stickier structure. These slushy environments could still be promising places to search for life.",
        "content": "A new examination of spacecraft data collected more than ten years ago suggests that Saturn's largest moon, Titan, probably does not contain a massive ocean beneath its frozen surface, as scientists once believed. Instead, moving downward through Titan's icy shell would likely reveal additional layers of ice that gradually transition into slushy pathways and isolated pockets of liquid water closer to the moon's rocky interior.\n\nEarlier interpretations of data from NASA's Cassini mission to Saturn led scientists to propose a deep ocean of liquid water hidden beneath Titan's ice. When researchers tested that idea using computer models, however, the results did not align with the physical characteristics seen in the data. A closer reanalysis produced new -- slushier -- conclusions. These results may prompt scientists to revisit assumptions about other icy worlds and refine how they search for life on Titan.\n\n\"Instead of an open ocean like we have here on Earth, we're probably looking at something more like Arctic sea ice or aquifers, which has implications for what type of life we might find, but also the availability of nutrients, energy and so on,\" said Baptiste Journaux, a University of Washington assistant professor of Earth and space sciences.\n\nThe study, published Dec. 17 in Nature, was led by NASA, with contributions from Journaux and Ula Jones, a UW graduate student of Earth and space sciences in his lab.\n\nCassini's Legacy and Titan's Unusual Surface\n\nThe Cassini mission began in 1997 and continued for nearly two decades, gathering extensive information about Saturn and its 274 moons. Titan -- shrouded by a hazy atmosphere -- stands out as the only place besides Earth where liquid is known to exist on the surface. With temperatures near -297 degrees Fahrenheit, that liquid is methane, not water. Methane forms lakes on Titan and even falls from the sky as rain.\n\nAs Titan travels around Saturn in an elongated orbit, scientists noticed that the moon stretches and compresses depending on its position relative to the planet. In 2008, researchers argued that this pronounced flexing could only occur if a large ocean existed beneath Titan's crust.\n\n\"The degree of deformation depends on Titan's interior structure. A deep ocean would permit the crust to flex more under Saturn's gravitational pull, but if Titan were entirely frozen, it wouldn't deform as much,\" Journaux said. \"The deformation we detected during the initial analysis of the Cassini mission data could have been compatible with a global ocean, but now we know that isn't the full story.\"\n\nA Subtle Time Lag Reveals a Slushy Interior\n\nThe new research adds an important factor that earlier studies did not fully consider: timing. Titan's changes in shape lag roughly 15 hours behind the strongest pull from Saturn's gravity. Moving a thick, sticky material requires more energy than shifting a free flowing liquid, similar to how stirring honey takes more effort than stirring water. By measuring this delay, scientists could estimate how much energy Titan absorbs as it deforms, offering insight into how thick or viscous its interior must be.\n\nThe amount of energy lost, or dissipated, inside Titan turned out to be far greater than expected if a global liquid ocean were present.\n\n\"Nobody was expecting very strong energy dissipation inside Titan. That was the smoking gun indicating that Titan's interior is different from what was inferred from previous analyses,\" said Flavio Petricca, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and lead author of the study.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers propose an interior made up largely of slush, with significantly less liquid water than previously assumed. This slushy material is thick enough to explain the delayed response to Saturn's gravity, while still containing enough water to allow Titan to change shape.\n\nRadio Signals and Extreme Physics Support the Model\n\nPetricca reached these conclusions by analyzing the frequencies of radio waves transmitted from the Cassini spacecraft during close fly-bys of Titan. Journaux helped interpret the results using thermodynamics. His work focuses on how water and minerals behave under intense pressure, knowledge that is critical for understanding whether other planetary environments might support life.\n\n\"The watery layer on Titan is so thick, the pressure is so immense, that the physics of water changes. Water and ice behave in a different way than sea water here on Earth,\" Journaux said.\n\nAt his planetary cryo-mineral physics laboratory at UW, researchers have spent years developing methods to recreate the extreme conditions found on other worlds. Using this work, Journaux provided Petricca and his colleagues with data describing how water and ice are expected to behave deep inside Titan.\n\n\"We could help them determine what gravitational signal they should expect to see based on the experiments made here at UW,\" Journaux said. \"It was very rewarding.\"\n\nWhat Sl",

        "title": "La década de los alquileres imposibles",
        "summary": "El precio al que se anuncian los pisos en España ha subido casi cuatro veces más que los salarios desde 2016",
        "content": "Cuando Miguel Murillo, madrileño de 27 años, decidió volver a la capital hace seis meses se dio de bruces con la realidad del mercado inmobiliario. Aunque lleva viviendo de manera independiente desde los 21, hasta ahora había tenido “suerte”. “Cuando tienes suerte es porque tiras de alguien conocido”, define a partir de su experiencia anterior, cuatro años en Barcelona alquilando habitación en el piso de una amiga. Pero eso se acabó al cambiar de trabajo y de ciudad. Este ingeniero aspira a comprar casa algún día, pero ahora mismo lo ve imposible porque la renta mensual consume buena parte de su sueldo: “Los precios suben más rápido que mis ahorros”, resume. Y los datos le dan la razón: desde 2016, los salarios han crecido en España en torno a un 24%, mientras que los arrendamientos que se anuncian en los portales inmobiliarios lo han hecho, de media, un 92%. Un decenio, en suma, de alquileres cada vez más imposibles.\n\nLa ley estatal de vivienda sitúa las “condiciones asequibles” de la vivienda en el 30% de los ingresos del hogar. Es decir, no destinar más de ese porcentaje a todo lo que supone la casa. Un cálculo aproximado (la norma habla de ingresos netos y contempla no solo el pago de la renta o hipoteca, sino de suministros básicos como agua o internet) apunta a 2016 como un momento clave en la encrucijada de la vivienda. En torno a ese año, un piso de tamaño mediano (80 metros cuadrados) comenzó a superar, según los precios de oferta de los portales, el 30% de un salario medio bruto. El año pasado se superó el 40%.\n\nPero ese camino hacia la inasequibilidad de los alquileres no ha sido lineal. En la serie se ven leves altibajos, que la economista Paloma Taltavull atribuye a ligeras mejoras por la subida del salario mínimo profesional. Porque lo que esta catedrática de la Universidad de Alicante tiene claro es que “el problema de accesibilidad a la vivienda no es solo un problema de altos alquileres, sino de bajos sueldos”. “Gran parte de los demandantes de alquiler no pueden comprar una propiedad, esta es una de las barreras que se encuentran desde la crisis financiera”, explica.\n\nY toda la demanda no satisfecha en la compra, alimentada por la continúa creación de nuevos hogares —con el chorro extra que ha supuesto en los últimos años la llegada de cientos de miles de personas del exterior para atender las necesidades del mercado laboral en una economía que crece muy por encima de sus semejantes— ha complicado más las cosas desde el punto de vista inmobiliario. “El cóctel está servido, y resulta en una aceleración brutal de los precios”, resume Taltavull.\n\nLa subida general que se observa en los datos de Fotocasa, del 92%, palidece al poner la lupa en algunas zonas. Entre las diez ciudades más pobladas de España, tres de ellas (Valencia, Alicante y Murcia) han visto duplicarse los precios que se piden por los arrendamientos desde 2016. Málaga queda cerca de esa marca (un 96% más) y en todas salvo Barcelona los importes han, como mínimo, multiplicado por dos el incremento salarial medio. En la capital catalana, la única de las diez urbes donde se aplican controles de precios conforme a la ley estatal, el incremento es menos abultado, pero partía de niveles muy altos y sigue siendo la más cara.\n\nQue los alquileres discurran por un camino tan distinto al de los sueldos o el propio coste de la vida (el IPC general ha subido un 26,4% desde 2016) tiene consecuencias a la hora de buscar piso. “Detectamos una brecha cada vez más profunda entre las expectativas de los inquilinos y la realidad que ofrece el mercado”, asegura la directora de Estudios de Fotocasa, María Matos. Los sondeos periódicos de mercado que realiza ese portal apuntan que un 46% de quienes viven de alquiler lo hacen por obligación, porque no pueden comprar. “Se trata de un fenómeno en aumento, que ha crecido ocho puntos porcentuales desde 2023”, completa Matos.\n\nA eso se suman otras dificultades: un 30% de quienes buscan piso acaban arrendando una habitación porque no encuentran otra cosa, un 35% de los encuestados aseguran que no tienen suficiente dinero para la fianza y los gastos iniciales de un alquiler; y un 58% dicen tener dificultades para el pago mensual de la renta. Muchos de los indicadores que contempla el estudio demoscópico de Fotocasa han empeorado en los últimos años.\n\nLa “presión” de los inquilinos\n\nLa sensación, en definitiva, es que el alquiler se ha convertido en una carrera de obstáculos. Y algo muy parecido es lo que relata Juan Ángel Barajas, un estudiante mexicano de 28 años que actualmente cursa estudios de posgrado en Barcelona. Rentó una habitación por 615 euros, un precio que en su caso, al tener que convertir los pesos que le sustentan en euros, resultaba insostenible. A través de contactos personales, acaba de encontrar otra habitación por 450 euros. Pero solo se puede quedar dos meses. “Es como comprar tiempo”, describe, “sé que pronto tendré que volver a buscar y que eso conlleva un esfuerzo físico y emocional,",

        "content": "As investigators work to find a motive behind the mass shooting at Brown University and the slaying of an acclaimed MIT professor, former classmates of the accused killer described him as a brilliant but exceptionally difficult student.\n\nClaudio Neves Valente, the 48-year-old suspect who police say was found dead Thursday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was a top student but a disruptive personality in his native Portugal, recalled classmates on Friday.\n\nNeves Valente studied at Instituto Superior Técnico along with Nuno Loureiro, the MIT professor he is now accused of shooting to death. The school confirmed to CNN that both men were students there between 1995 and 2000, and that Neves Valente studied for a degree in Technological Physics Engineering.\n\nThat engineering course was full of gifted students, recalled classmate Felipe Moura – but Neves Valente stood out, for good and bad reasons.\n\n“Claudio was obviously one of the best, but in class he had a great need to stand out and show that he was better than the rest,” Moura wrote in Portuguese in a Facebook post.\n\n“Claudio’s attitude was unpleasant,” he continued, often arguing with “colleagues he didn’t consider as brilliant as him (and who probably weren’t),” he wrote. “They were totally unnecessary quarrels, which did not help the class at all.”\n\nMoura, who now teaches at a Lisbon university, did not respond to messages from CNN. A former classmate, who asked not to be quoted by name, confirmed that Moura’s Facebook account was authentic.\n\nIn an interview with Público, a newspaper in Portugal, Moura echoed his impressions of Neves Valente as an aggressive classmate.\n\n“He had a confrontational personality in class. In other words, the other good students would intervene, ask questions, [but] Claudio liked to say that he was the one who knew,” Moura told the paper.\n\nNuno Morais, another classmate, told Público that Neves Valente and Loureiro were among the top students at the school – but their personalities were starkly different.\n\n“Claudio was one of the students with the best grades in the course. He was much more theoretical,” Morais told the paper. “Nuno was also a good student, he stood out less in terms of grades, but he was a more relaxed person—and seemed to have a knack for slightly more applied subjects.”\n\nAfter graduating in Portugal, Neves Valente enrolled at Brown University in 2000 as a graduate student in physics but did not finish the program. Moura said he stayed in touch with Neves Valente at the time and found that he was once again clashing with other students.\n\n“I exchanged many emails with him at the time and saw that he maintained the same attitude — as he told me —of maintaining unnecessary conflicts with PhD colleagues in class, which he again considered far less capable than he was,” Moura wrote on Facebook. “I could tell that he wasn’t enjoying being at Brown University.”\n\nScott Watson, a classmate at Brown, said Valente was “socially awkward” and that he became his only friend at the university. He struggled in the US, complaining bitterly that classes weren’t challenging and that the food was poor, Watson recalled.\n\n“He would say the classes were too easy—honestly, for him they were. He already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive,” Watson, who is now a professor at Syracuse University, said in a statement shared with CNN.\n\nWatson said Valente could be “kind and gentle” but that he was also volatile as well.\n\n“He often became frustrated—sometimes angry—about courses, professors, and living conditions,” Watson said, recalling that once he had to break up a fight between Valente and another classmate he often insulted.\n\nMoura said he tried to convince Valente to stay with the graduate program, but he left after one year.\n\n“Claudio thought none of it was worth it, which was a waste of time and the others were all incapable,” he said on Facebook.\n\nIn an archived Brown website, Neves Valente appears to write to classmates that he’s left the school “permanently.” The note, first reported by the New York Times, includes an email address to reach him and a cryptic note: “The best liar is he who is able to fool himself. They are everywhere, but sometimes proliferate in the most unexpected places.”\n\nA directory of physics graduate students at Brown from that time links to the website alongside a student email address for Neves Valente. The directory shows that he was assigned to room 122 at the Barus and Holley engineering building. Neves Valente carried out his shooting in room 166 in the same building last week, police say.\n\nIt’s unclear what Neves Valente did in the intervening years. Moura wrote on Facebook that he heard he’d returned to Portugal to work for an internet provider; police say he received a visa and returned to the US in 2017, though it is unclear what he did for work.\n\nHis last known address was in Miami, police said.\n\nHis former classmates have been left trying to understand what could have mot",

        "title": "Phones were fashionable again in 2025",
        "summary": "From the wooden-back Motorola Razr Ultra to the iPhone 17 Pro’s vibrant turn in Cosmic Orange, phones made more fashion statements than usual in 2025.",
        "content": "is a senior reviewer with over a decade of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview.\n\nA year or two ago, when a phone showed up at my door for review, I could pretty much count on it being black, gray, or maybe (as a treat) white. But in 2025, that hasn’t been the case. Phones I reviewed this year featured everything from real wood grain back panels to deep blue finishes, with color-coordinated crossbody straps and magnetic accessories to match. For an industry that has been content to churn out a lot of black rectangular gadgets, 2025 marked a welcome return to bold colors and fashion-forward accessories from phone manufacturers.\n\nPhones haven’t always been boring, utilitarian objects. Remember the original bright pink Motorola Razr? Iconic. Or more recently, Nokia’s neon yellow Lumia phones — you couldn’t miss them. Even the ever-conservative iPhone appeared in vibrant orange, yellow, and blue options in 2018’s XR; my husband refused to part with his until absolutely necessary because he didn’t want to give up his yellow phone. But somewhere along the way in the past five years, phone makers decided that these devices should be more serious, and the fun options fell by the wayside.\n\nJust look at that beaut. Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nIf any single company deserves recognition for bringing style back, it’s Motorola. The Razr Ultra foldable in MountainTrail is easily the best-looking phone I used this year, but maybe I’m just partial to the Moto X vibes the wooden back evokes. The bronze-colored side rails, the satisfying sound as the flip phone snaps shut — it’s all so nice. But it’s not just foldables — Motorola has been way ahead of the curve with vibrant colors and unique finishes for the past year or so. I wish Moto’s software looked as pristine — lately it’s been stuffed to the gills with ads and bloatware — but the company has definitely nailed good-looking hardware.\n\nEven product lines that are traditionally conservative with color got some splashier options this year. 2025 gave us the Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro, for the truly bold among us. The standard iPhone 17 also comes in some fetching colors, which hasn’t been a given in recent years — no repeat of the iPhone 15’s washed-out color options, thankfully. Even Google offered its folding phone in something other than black or white for the first time: a gray-ish Moonstone and a subtle greenish-yellow Jade.\n\nOrange might not be everyone’s thing, but at least we finally got a Pro iPhone in a real color. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n\nBut it hasn’t been just the phones themselves. This year, manufacturers seemed to remember that phone accessories can be fashionable, too. Apple launched this year’s iPhones with a new crossbody strap accessory, available in a range of colors to coordinate with its cases. And later in the year, we got the crossbody sock, er, iPhone Pocket, created with fashion designer Issey Miyake. Starting at $229 for the long version, it’s a luxury that won’t appeal to most people, but it makes a strong statement.\n\nGoogle also released a line of magnetic accessories called Pixelsnap to go with its Pixel 10 series, which includes a ring of MagSafe-esque magnets in the rear panel. I used the Pixel 10 Pro Fold almost exclusively with the handy ring grip, which, in addition to relieving some of the fatigue from holding the phone for a long time, doubles as a nice-looking object adorning the back of the phone. For someone like me who hates using cases, it’s a welcome way to add utility and a hint of style.\n\nThe Pixelsnap ring grip doubles as a nice-looking fashion accessory. Image: Google\n\nNot everyone wants a flashy color or statement-making accessory for their phone, and that’s fine. But I think it’s also fine to care about how your phone looks and to want something a little less utilitarian and a little more fashionable than a black rectangle. After all, we look at our phones one million times a day! It only makes sense that we should like what we see. Whatever was in the water this year encouraging manufacturers to fancy up their phones, I hope it sticks around in 2026.",

        "content": "„Der Playboy-Prinz“ macht seinem Namen alle Ehre: Im Kontext der Epstein-Akten wurde jetzt ein nie zuvor gesehenes Foto von Prinz Andrew (heute 65) veröffentlicht. Der Lieblingssohn der Queen liegt auf den Schößen von fünf Frauen, dahinter lacht Epsteins Komplizin Ghislaine Maxwell (heute 63)\n\nWashington (USA) – Ausgerechnet Schloss Sandringham! Das geliebte Landhaus der britischen Königsfamilie, Ort für Weihnachtsbraten, Bescherung und Familienfrieden, wird jetzt zur Bühne eines neuen Royal-Skandals. Ein frisch veröffentlichtes Schwarz-Weiß-Foto aus den Epstein-Akten zeigt Andrew in einer Szene, die im Palast für blankes Entsetzen sorgen dürfte.\n\nDer Queen-Sohn liegt auf den Beinen fünf junger Frauen, direkt vor dem Kamin von Sandringham. Dort, wo sonst Queen Elizabeth II. nach dem Weihnachtsdinner mit ihrer Familie zusammensaß, wo die Royals noch heute Geschenke austauschen und Traditionen pflegen, steht auf dem Bild im Hintergrund eine lachende Ghislaine Maxwell – die verurteilte Komplizin des Sexualstraftäters Jeffrey Epstein (†66). Ein bitterer Kontrast zu dem Ort, der für Pflichtbewusstsein, Familie und königliche Würde steht.\n\nDas Schwarz-Weiß-Foto dürfte primär bei König Charles III. für Bauchschmerzen sorgen.\n\nAndrew brachte Ghislaine mit nach Sandringham\n\nOffenbar wurde das Partyfoto von Andrew und Ghislaine mit den jungen Frauen im Salon von Sandringham aufgenommen. Wer die jungen Frauen vor dem Kamin des Landhauses sind, ist nicht bekannt. Die US-Behörden haben ihre Gesichter vor der Veröffentlichung geschwärzt. Das Bild ist undatiert, die nun freigegebenen Fotos kommen ohne Kontext. Doch jetzt steht in Großbritannien die Frage im Raum, welche Art von Partys in Sandringham House gefeiert wurden.\n\nDas Originalfoto wurde eingerahmt. Jeffrey Epstein stellte oft gerahmte Fotos auf seinen Schreibtischen aus, die ihn oder Ghislaine Maxwell mit Prominenten zeigten. Dieses Foto ist undatiert, doch im Jahr 2000 schmiss Andrew eine Party für Ghislaine auf dem royalen Landsitz Sandringham\n\nFest steht: Andrew überraschte Ghislaine Maxwell im Dezember 2000 in Sandringham mit einem Geburtstagsfest. 2019 nannte er es in seinem desaströsen BBC-Interview „ein ganz gewöhnliches Jagdwochenende“. Auf dem nun veröffentlichten Foto scheint es jedoch, als hätte Andrew etwas ganz anderes im Sinn, als Fasane zu schießen.",

        "content": "Syrian state television denounces the Israeli incursion as another violation of the nation’s sovereignty.\n\nIsraeli forces have advanced into the Quneitra area of Syria’s occupied Golan Heights and set up two military checkpoints, an Al Jazeera correspondent on the ground reports.\n\nThe Israeli military operation on Saturday took place in the villages of Ain Ziwan and al-Ajraf in the southern part of the country.\n\nFor months, Israeli forces have conducted near-daily incursions into southern Syria, particularly in the Quneitra governorate, carrying out arrests, erecting checkpoints, and bulldozing land, all of which have prompted growing public anger and unrest.\n\nSyrian state television said the Israeli incursion was a violation of Syrian sovereignty, noting that the army used five military vehicles to set up the checkpoint in Ain Ziwan.\n\nThe latest raid comes one day after Israeli forces advanced towards the towns of al-Asha, Bir Ajam, Bariqa, Umm al-Azam and Ruwayhina in the southern Quneitra countryside, according to the Syrian News Agency (SANA).\n\nDozens of Syrians on Friday protested the Israeli incursion in the city of al-Salam in the Quneitra Governorate, condemning the ongoing Israeli attacks against citizens and their properties.\n\nThe demonstrators, part of a group called “Syrians with Palestine”, held banners denouncing what they stated were repeated Israeli violations of Syrian lands.\n\nDespite a reduction in direct military threats, the Israeli army continues to carry out air raids that have caused civilian casualties and destroyed Syrian army sites and facilities.\n\nOver the past year, Israel has launched more than 600 air, drone or artillery attacks across Syria, averaging nearly two attacks a day, according to a tally by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsraeli military incursions have become more brazen, more frequent and more violent since Israel expanded its occupation of southern Syria following the ousting of President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.\n\nDisengagement accord\n\nAfter al-Assad’s fall, Israel declared the 1974 Disengagement Agreement – brokered after the 1973 war, in which Syria failed to regain the occupied Golan Heights – void.\n\nThe agreement had established a UN-patrolled buffer zone, which Israel has since violated, advancing deeper into Syrian territory.\n\nCiting al-Assad’s flight, Israel says the accord no longer applies, while carrying out air raids, ground incursions, reconnaissance flights; setting up checkpoints; and arresting or disappearing Syrians. Syria has not responded with attacks.\n\nIn September, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa stated that Israel had conducted more than 1,000 air attacks and more than 400 ground incursions in Syria since al-Assad was overthrown, describing the actions as “very dangerous”.\n\nSyrians believe that the continuation of these violations hinders efforts to restore stability in the region and undermines attempts to improve the economic situation in southern Syria.\n\nAl Jazeera visited Quneitra in recent weeks and spoke to Syrians about Israeli incursions and abductions there, which have stoked fears.\n\nSyria and Israel are currently in talks to reach an agreement that Damascus hopes will secure a halt to Israel’s air raids on its territory and the withdrawal of Israeli troops who have pushed into southern Syria.\n\nIn the background, the United States has been pushing diplomatic efforts to restore the 1974 deal.",

        "title": "The real reason incomes rise and why they drop",
        "summary": "Getting ahead financially is mainly about what you earn at work, not what you make from investments. Researchers found that promotions, skills, and better jobs drive most upward income movement. But when people slip backward, falling investment income is usually the main reason. Labor builds income steadily; capital is riskier and more unpredictable.",
        "content": "Economists use the term \"income mobility\" to describe how easily people or families can move up or down the income scale compared with others in their community. It reflects whether financial positions tend to stay fixed or change over time.\n\nNorway stands out for having relatively high income mobility. Many people are able to improve their financial standing, but the system also allows incomes to fall. Movement goes in both directions.\n\n\"Your income is the sum of what you earn from work and from capital income,\" says Professor Roberto Iacono at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology's (NTNU) Department of Social Work.\n\nCapital income refers to money earned from assets such as shares, housing, or business ownership.\n\nWhile economists have long studied income mobility, there has been much less focus on how different income sources contribute to these changes. In particular, the distinct roles of earnings from work and income from capital have not been closely examined.\n\nThat gap led Iacono and his colleagues to ask two key questions. What helps people move up financially, and what causes them to fall behind compared with others?\n\nJobs Are the Main Driver of Income Gains\n\nTo find answers, Iacono worked with Marco Ranaldi from University College London and Joël Bühler from Universitat de Barcelona. The team analyzed detailed records from Norway's income registers (Statistics Norway), covering nearly 300,000 people aged 26 and older. They also developed a new approach to track how labor income and capital income influence earnings over an entire working life.\n\nThe results were clear.\n\n\"When people's income increases compared to others, it is largely due to what their earnings from work,\" Iacono said.\n\nIn practical terms, this means having a well paying job is the most important factor in getting ahead financially. Income from investments can help, but it rarely plays the leading role in long term income growth.\n\nThe picture changes, however, when incomes begin to fall.\n\nWhy Falling Incomes Are Linked to Capital\n\n\"When people's income declines compared to others, it is mostly due to the fact that their capital income is declining,\" says Iacono.\n\nLosses from investments, property, or businesses tend to be the biggest reason people slip down the income ladder. These declines often happen at the same time as lower earnings from work, but capital income plays the dominant role.\n\nFor most people, steady employment remains essential for improving their financial position.\n\n\"Labor income systematically lifts individuals up in comparison to others. Capital income, which is more unstable and concentrated, is more often associated with decreasing income,\" Iacono said.\n\nWhy Labor and Capital Behave So Differently\n\nAccording to Iacono, labor income and capital income operate in fundamentally different ways, which explains their contrasting effects on income mobility.\n\n\"Employment income often increases gradually throughout life, such as when we gain more experience, switch to better jobs or increase our skills. These processes mean that many people's incomes increase over time,\" he said.\n\nCapital income follows a very different pattern.\n\n\"Capital income is more unevenly distributed; it fluctuates a lot and can easily fall if the markets go down or an investment fails. A few earn very well on capital, but for most this is more uncertain and more often results in a decline than sustained growth,\" Iacono said.\n\nAccess to capital also varies widely. High income individuals receive a much larger share of their earnings from investments than the rest of the population. For the majority of people, wages and salaries remain the primary source of income.\n\nBuilding Stability Through Work First\n\nAs a result, most cases of upward income mobility are driven by employment income, either on its own or alongside smaller amounts of capital income.\n\n\"Lasting progress in an income position is usually based on solid income from work, which can later make it possible to save and earn more capital,\" he said.\n\nThe findings suggest that for most people, financial progress starts with stable earnings from work. Capital income may follow later, but it is rarely the foundation.",

        "title": "Here’s What’s in the DOJ’s Epstein Files Release—and What’s Missing",
        "summary": "From photos of former president Bill Clinton to images of strange scrapbooks, the Justice Department’s release is curious but far from revelatory.",
        "content": "The United States Department of Justice on Friday published the first of an unknown number of releases of documents related to infamous sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The nearly 4,000 files contain a hodgepodge of photos, handwritten notes, and more. What they do not contain are any clear revelations about who else may be criminally implicated in Epstein’s abuse network.\n\nReleased in four volumes, the 3,951 documents the DOJ included in Friday’s release represent only a fraction of the files the department is required to release under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Democratic lawmakers scolded the DOJ for withholding large portions of its archive, accusing the department of failing to comply with the law’s disclosure mandate.\n\nThe documents the Justice Department did release contain hundreds of images of Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his onetime girlfriend and convicted accomplice in a yearslong sex trafficking operation, along with other associates, celebrities, and politicians. Despite long-standing scrutiny of Donald Trump’s social ties to Epstein, the president appears only sporadically in the initial release of material—for instance, in a framed photo on top of a dresser showing him and Melania Trump with Epstein.\n\nIt is currently unclear when the DOJ will release additional documents or what will be included in any subsequent releases. CNN has reported on frustrations within the DOJ over the allegedly vague guidance lawyers responsible for redacting the material were given, while Fox News has reported that the same standards used to protect victims were applied to “politically exposed individuals and government officials.” For now, here’s a rundown of what you’ll find in the DOJ’s December 19 trove.\n\nVolume 1\n\nThe first batch of documents the DOJ released contains 3,158 images of the inside of Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse and Virgin Islands compound. These include several photographs of a painting of Bill Clinton wearing a blue dress and red high heels mounted next to a framed, handwritten letter, the author of which can’t be made out. There are also dozens of photos of Epstein with women and, in at least two cases, what appear to be babies; their faces are redacted.\n\nOne photo is of a binder marked Black Family Trustee Meeting November 21, 2014; another appears to be of a Bank of America statement from 2011 for an account purportedly bearing the names of financier Leon Black as well as his wife Debra Black and a former employee. (Another set of images shows a note signed by a person with the same first name as the former employee along with a ledger of expenses from late 2011 into early 2012.) Other noteworthy documentation relates to Epstein’s placement on a sex offenders registry and a 2019 note from the acting US attorney for the US Virgin Islands informing him that he would need to comply with certain travel restrictions despite previous “provisions.”\n\nThe redactions are inconsistent. In a handwritten note to Epstein, a signature is redacted, while in another image of that same note, the name “Kathe” is visible. A calligraphed note, seemingly written by a young woman and thanking Epstein for taking her and her sister on several “adventures,” has the signature redacted, but an envelope in a similar hand bears the name of the sender.",

Unidas por Extremadura llega a las elecciones lanzada de ánimo y expectativas, dispuesta a darle un buen bocado al PSOE y a conseguir cambiar el estado de ánimo que atraviesa el espacio político.\n\nLa candidatura de Podemos e Izquierda Unida -en la que testimonialmente está Alianza Verde- ha encontrado en la unidad, la paz interna, la estabilidad y el respeto mutuo las bases desde la que, después, ha construido un proyecto político que interpela al votante de izquierdas desde un discurso exigente, inconformista y comprensible, en el que su cabeza de lista, Irene de Miguel, ha sabido llenar el agujero dejado por el PSOE y, más concretamente, por su candidato, Miguel Ángel Gallardo.\n\nEs al electorado socialista al que más se ha dirigido De Miguel en busca de los votantes defraudados por la labor de oposición en Extremadura a PP y Vox y por la falta de soluciones a los problemas cotidianos que llegan por parte del Gobierno de España. Un doble caudal de votos que ha incrementado las perspectivas electorales de Unidas por Extremadura y que le lleva moverse en cifras próximas a las que consiguió Podemos en 2015, cuando se abrió paso en la política autonómica.\n\nLas encuestas dibujan un crecimiento de entre tres y cuatro puntos que le puede reportar entre los cinco y seis escaños. Ahora mismo está en cuatro con un 6% del voto.\n\nLa candidatura extremeña es un oasis en la tensión que a nivel nacional vive el espacio. Lidera Podemos, Izquierda Unida tiene un papel destacado y Sumar no está. Y no lo hace porque literalmente no existe en la comunidad autónoma más allá de un puñado de militantes. Por primera vez desde 2023, una lista electoral recupera la fórmula de Unidas Podemos (o sea, los morados e IU) y deja a un lado el proyecto de Díaz. En realidad, su ausencia en la lista tiene que ver con dos factores: el veto de Podemos a pactar con la vicepresidenta segunda -y no se ha querido librar esa guerra- y el dar continuidad y paz a un proyecto que funcionó en 2023 y que promete ahora.\n\nPor todo esto, se ha hablado mucho, y sobre todo se hablará después del resultado, del experimento de unidad que ha vivido el espacio de la izquierda en Extremadura. El más interesado en elevar la particularidad a categoría será Podemos, que sacará pecho de que su fórmula es la única viable. Es decir, liderar ellos y dejar fuera de todo pacto a Díaz.\n\nLa realidad en otros lugares es más compleja. En Andalucía y Castilla y León las candidaturas que se están construyendo separan a Podemos e IU y los segundos están aliándose con Sumar. La prueba estará en Aragón, donde, encima, aparece en la ecuación una fuerza territorial (Chunta).\n\nEl ecosistema de la unidad dará para muchas lecturas y, por eso, que De Miguel dijera el otro día que Díaz «ha sido un poco fraude» para la izquierda mete aún más picante.",

Ein ausnehmend schöner Treffer: Martin Terrier erwischte einen Kopfball schulbuchmäßig, als unhaltbare Bogenlampe senkte sich der Ball ins Tor. Zugleich ein Treffer, der nicht im Ansatz mit dem Kunstwerk mithalten konnte, das Terrier in der Vorwoche gegen Köln zustande gebracht hatte: Damals hatte Terrier einen Hackenvolley mit Blick zum Tor versenkt, international gern »scorpion kick« genannt. Nach seinem Achillessehnenriss scheint der Franzose, der etwa das gesamte Kapitel Erik ten Hag nur aus der Reha erlebt hatte, in Leverkusen angekommen. Dass man ihm im und am Strafraum keinen Platz lassen sollte, muss sich in der Bundesliga noch rumsprechen.",

        "content": "Social media response to Vance's 2021 Epstein post\n\nDamn, this post didn't age well.\n\nYou’re not gonna believe this\n\nSo? What happened bro?\n\nany updates on this, champ\n\nHey man, it’s not looking so good right now\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2021 tweet from US vice president JD Vance has gone viral, in which he asked: “What possible interest would the US government have in keeping Epstein’s clients secret?”The X post resurfaced again as thousands of pages of newly released Epstein files were made public by the House Oversight Committee this week.Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna responded to the viral post, writing: “Great question, JD Vance. Have you asked Attorney General Pam Bondi? She is brazenly breaking the law Rep Thomas Massie and I led and insulting MAGA voters' intelligence with excessive redactions and concealment.”Representative Thomas Massie also joined the conversation, commenting: “I miss this version of JD Vance.”The newly released files include a large collection of legal documents, photos, and correspondence related to convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy, influential associates. The documents feature images of big figures and correspondence with Epstein, but many are heavily redacted, and some remain without context or dates. Both Khanna and Massie played key roles in pressing the Justice Department to release the materials. They pressured the GOP administration and utilised the public’s right to transparency and accountability in the investigation of Epstein’s dirty network. Their oversight helped ensure that the files, which had been withheld for years, are now available for public and congressional review.MAGA leader JD Vance has spoken out in defence of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein files, saying there is “nothing to hide” and that Trump instructed the Justice Department to release all relevant information. He criticised previous Democratic administrations, especially Biden's, for failing to act on Epstein’s activities and questioned why legacy media is only being active recently.",

        "content": "German engineer Michaela Benthaus, who has paraplegia, traveled to space with Jeff Bezos' company Blue Origin.\n\nGerman engineer Michaela Benthaus on Saturday became the first person with paraplegia to travel to space.\n\nThe brief suborbital trip was carried out by US billionaire Jeff Bezos' space tourism company Blue Origin.\n\nThe Saturday expedition was the 16th crewed flight for the firm.\n\nAlso on board were former space engineer Hans Königsmann of Germany and four US entrepreneurs.\n\nThe New Shepard NS-37 launched off from a Bezos property in West Texas at 8:15 a.m. local time (1415 UTC) for a flight that lasted around 11 minutes.\n\nThe vessel reached an altitude of approximately 100 kilometers (around 62 miles).\n\nThe passengers experienced a brief moment of weightlessness as part of the trip.\n\nDozens of people have traveled to space with Blue Origin, including pop singer Katy Perry and former Star Trek actor William Shatner. The firm aims to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nThe Blue Origin capsule landed in a desert area of West Texas in the southwestern United States Image: Blue Origin/AP Photo/picture alliance\n\n'It was the coolest experience ever'\n\nBenthaus, who is 33, was exuberant about her experience in space in comments made after her return to Earth.\n\n\"It was the coolest experience ever, honestly,\" the engineer, who works at the European Space Agency (ESA), said.\n\n\"I think you should never give up on your dreams. There's also sometimes just a low probability that it comes true,\" she said.\n\nBenthaus sustained a spinal injury during a mountain bike accident at the age of 26 and now uses a wheelchair.\n\nShe called for the world to improve accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\n\"After my accident … I really, really figured out how inaccessible our world still is,\" she said, saying that facilities for disabled people are required in order to form an \"inclusive society.\"\n\nEdited by: Dmytro Hubenko",

        "content": "La missione NS-37 di Blue Origin ha completato il lancio e il recupero della capsula New Shepard nel deserto del Texas, portando in orbita suborbitale l'ingegnera tedesca dell'ESA Michaela Benthaus. Si tratta del primo volo spaziale di una persona che utilizza abitualmente la sedia a rotelle, un evento che ha permesso di testare l'adattabilità delle attuali tecnologie di volo a diverse esigenze fisiche. Al termine della missione, che ha visto il rientro controllato sia del booster che del modulo dell'equipaggio, Benthaus ha descritto l'esperienza soffermandosi sull'importanza di rendere le infrastrutture spaziali accessibili a una platea più ampia di ricercatori e civili. L'operazione ha confermato l'efficacia delle modifiche tecniche apportate alla capsula per garantire la sicurezza e la gestione dei movimenti in assenza di gravità per persone con paraplegia. L'esperienza di Michaela Benthaus, ingegnera aerospaziale presso l'agenzia europea, fornisce dati utili per lo sviluppo dei futuri protocolli di volo inclusivi. Il successo dell'atterraggio e la successiva intervista ai protagonisti hanno evidenziato come l'industria aerospaziale stia iniziando a considerare la diversità fisica non più come un ostacolo insormontabile, ma come un nuovo standard operativo per le prossime missioni commerciali e scientifiche.",

Das südamerikanische Land habe Öl, Land und andere Vermögenswerte von den USA gestohlen, hieß es als Begründung.\n\nVenezuelas autoritärer Staatschef Nicolás Maduro nutze »das Öl aus diesen gestohlenen Ölfeldern zur Finanzierung von Drogenterrorismus, Menschenhandel, Mord und Entführungen«, so Trump. Auf seiner Plattform »Truth Social« schrieb er drohend : »Venezuela ist vollständig von der größten Armada umzingelt, die jemals in der Geschichte Südamerikas zusammengestellt wurde.«",

        "content": "The ammunition boxes stacked on the stage opened up to reveal figurines of angels and an infant Jesus lying in his manger. Six actors sang plaintive carols, accompanied by readings of the brooding poetry of Kharkiv writer Serhiy Zhadan. The audience sat, transfixed by the almost unbearable intensity of the spectacle.\n\nThe nativity play, performed on a recent evening at Kharkiv’s puppet theatre, was a reminder that conflict has seeped into the fabric of almost everything in Ukrainian life over the past four years. “We can’t just put on comedies and escape from reality,” said Oksana Dmitrieva, the nativity play’s 48-year-old director. “The stage is a mirror, and we have to live through our emotions again, but this time from outside ourselves, together with others,” she said.\n\nView image in fullscreen Oksana Dmitrieva, the director of Nativity Scene. War. Poems., at the Kharkiv puppet theatre.\n\nShe admitted, however, that dissecting the darker emotions on stage does not always translate to a lighter mind in real life. “Sometimes it’s possible to immerse yourself in the work, but sometimes I also lose my bearings and I wonder, ‘What comes next? What should we talk about? What buttons should we press? I guess that’s what every Ukrainian is living through now.”\n\nThis winter, the fourth since Russia’s full-scale invasion, threatens to be the bleakest yet for Ukraine. Trump, during his first year in office, has proved much more receptive to Moscow’s talking points than to Kyiv’s, Russian troops continue a slow but grinding advance in the Donbas region and missile attacks on energy infrastructure have left cities without power for hours on end, day after day. There are holes in the budget, a crisis in conscripting new recruits and – perhaps most devastatingly – the absence of a plausible positive outcome on the near-term horizon.\n\nThe glass-half-full view is that Ukraine’s continued existence as a state is in itself a positive outcome, and that while things are tough, there is no sign of an imminent collapse at the front. Military innovation in spheres such as drone production is booming, and in big cities like Kyiv and Kharkiv, there is still a vibrant metropolitan life, even amid the air alerts and blackouts. Growling generators on every street corner keep supermarkets, restaurants and bars open, and on a recent Friday evening, a 12,000 hryvnia (£212) champagne tasting event in Kyiv was sold out days in advance.\n\nView image in fullscreen Christmas decorations in the Kharkiv metro.\n\nBut as Donald Trump’s negotiators attempt to push the country towards the peace that so many crave but on terms that terrify them, and with questionable guarantees that Russia won’t simply resume its attacks in future, exhaustion and existential questions are rarely far from people’s minds.\n\n“This is one of the most difficult moments in our modern history, when every one of us is living on the edge between exhaustion and strength, between compromise and our principles,” said Sevgil Musaieva, the editor-in-chief of the popular news outlet Ukrainska Pravda, at a recent awards ceremony in Kyiv, honouring the 100 most influential Ukrainians of the year.\n\n“We know that this winter will be difficult, we understand that our army lacks people and weapons, we also see that the positions of some of our allies are changing. We are facing questions to which there are no simple answers,” she added.\n\nView image in fullscreen Kyiv in darkness in November after Russian attacks destroyed critical infrastructure.\n\nView image in fullscreen Shopping by phone torch in the Kyiv blackout.\n\nSimple answers are indeed in short supply these days. Ask people what they feel about the continuing peace negotiations and the answer will probably be long, anguished and often contradictory. Most people are ready for compromises, but few are ready for the kind of sacrifices that might persuade Vladimir Putin to stop fighting.\n\nDmitrieva is originally from Kramatorsk, one of the Donbas cities controlled by Ukraine, but which Trump has suggested Kyiv should cede to Russia as part of a peace agreement. “My niece is still in Kramatorsk, she didn’t run away, she’s working there. And what should we say to people like her, ‘Leave, this will be Russia now’? And what will happen to those who stay?”\n\nView image in fullscreen A central Kharkiv constructivist landmark from the Soviet era, the Derzhprom building was completed in 1928.\n\nThe closer to the frontline, the more tangible are the stakes, given that the Russian army’s mode of advancing has largely been by destroying the towns and cities in its path. One of the places to have already suffered that fate is Vovchansk, north-east of Kharkiv and just across the border from Russia.\n\nVovchansk was occupied in the first months of the war, but Ukraine won it back in September 2022. Oleksiy Kharkivskyi, the head of the town’s police force, raised the Ukrainian flag in the main square that month. Then, last summer, Moscow launched a sur",

        "content": "Malachi Toney takes a pop pass into the end zone to give Miami a 10-3 lead with 1:44 left in the game. (0:42)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas -- Malachi Toney's tiebreaking 11-yard touchdown reception with less than two minutes left lifted No. 10 seed Miami to a 10-3 victory over No. 7 Texas A&M on Saturday in the first round of the College Football Playoff.\n\nMark Fletcher Jr. had a career-high 172 yards rushing to help the Hurricanes (11-2) advance to the Cotton Bowl to face No. 2 seed Ohio State on Dec. 31.\n\nToney's big play came a series after what looked like a devastating mistake for the freshman. Toney made a reception, but Dalton Brooks knocked the ball out and Daymion Sanford recovered it on the Texas A&M 47 with about seven minutes to go. Teammates surrounded a visibly upset Toney on the bench, encouraging him and trying to keep him positive.\n\nHe and Miami's offense got another chance when Rueben Bain Jr. sacked Marcel Reed on two of three plays on the ensuing drive to force a punt.\n\nA career-long 56-yard run by Fletcher on the first play of the next drive got the Hurricanes to the Texas A&M 30 with about three minutes to go. Miami used four more runs by Fletcher to get into scoring position before Toney took the short toss from Carson Beck and dashed into the end zone.\n\nThe Aggies had a chance to tie it after that, but Bryce Fitzgerald intercepted Reed for the second time - this time in the end zone - to end it.\n\nThe Hurricanes used a suffocating defensive performance to stifle Texas A&M's powerful offense, which entered the game averaging 36.3 points a game. They harassed Reed into a mistake-filled performance that included a first-quarter fumble along with the interceptions. They sacked him seven times and flushed him out of the pocket and forced him to try to make tough throws again and again.\n\nHe was 25-of-39 for 257 yards but was unable to get the Aggies in the end zone for the first time this season.\n\nAfter getting the last at-large bid in the playoff, the Hurricanes now move on, with a chance to win their first national championship since 2001 in their first appearance in the CFP.\n\nCarter Davis missed three field goals in gusty winds after missing only two before Saturday. His 21-yard kick early in the third quarter got the Canes on the board after the first scoreless first half in CFP history.\n\nIt's a disappointing playoff debut for Texas A&M (11-2), which lost to rival Texas in its regular-season finale after opening the season with 11 straight wins.\n\nBeck, in his first season at Miami after a transfer from Georgia, was 14-of-20 for a season-low 103 yards.\n\nFacing a second-and-18 from his own 8, Reed made consecutive throws to Ashton Bethel-Roman for 15 and 13 yards. On third-and-10 later in the drive, he connected with Bethel-Roman again on a pass that was just enough for the first down and found Mario Craver for a 12-yard gain on the next play.\n\nThe drive stalled after that, but Randy Bond tied it with a 35-yard field goal with about eight minutes to go.\n\nThe Hurricanes opened the second half with a nine-play, 72-yard drive capped by a 21-yard field goal to make it 3-0. Keelan Marion had a 20-yard reception on that drive and Fletcher added a 24-yard run on third-and-4 to keep it alive.\n\nFitzgerald intercepted Reed and returned it 36 yards to the A&M 20. The Canes came up empty after the turnover when a 35-yard field goal attempt by Davis bounced off the left upright.\n\nReed fumbled late in the first quarter, but the Hurricanes were unable to cash in on the miscue. A 59-yard reception by Mario Craver got the Aggies to the 11-yard line early in the second. But they couldn't move the ball and attempted a 22-yard field goal, which was blocked by Bain. It was Miami's first blocked field goal since the season opener against Bethune-Cookman in 2022.\n\nToney's 55-yard punt return got the Hurricanes to the 25 with about six minutes left in the second quarter. He would have scored if not for a shoestring tackle by Marcus Ratcliffe. But Dalton Brooks sacked Beck on third down to force a 47-yard field goal attempt by Davis, which sailed wide right.\n\nPunter Tyler White's throw on a fake punt sailed just out of reach of a diving Marcus Ratcliffe to give Miami the ball on the Texas A&M 46 with less than two minutes remaining in the first half. Davis tried a field goal from 40 as time expired in the first half, but it was wide right again.",

        "summary": "In den neu veröffentlichten Epstein-Akten sind bisher nie gesehene Fotos seiner Komplizin Ghislaine Maxwell aufgetaucht.",
        "content": "Undatiertes Foto: Ghislaine Maxwell (heute 63) posiert hinter dem Steuer eines Luxus-Sportwagens und trägt dabei nur einen weißen Seidenmantel\n\nWashington, D.C. – Einst war sie High-Society-Lady, jetzt verurteilte Sexualstraftäterin im Gefängnis: Ghislaine Maxwell ist tiefer gefallen als kaum jemand zuvor. Doch lange vor ihrer Inhaftierung 2020 genoss sie ihr Luxusleben an der Seite von Milliardär Jeffrey Epstein in vollen Zügen. Das belegen neu veröffentlichte Fotos aus den Akten des Sexualstraftäters.\n\nDie Bilder stammen aus Epsteins persönlichem Archiv und zeigen Maxwell in auffälligen, provokanten Outfits. Ermittler sichteten die Dateien im Zuge der Untersuchungen. Die Aufnahmen werfen ein grelles Licht auf das luxuriöse Leben hinter verschlossenen Türen – und auf die enge Rolle, die Maxwell an Epsteins Seite spielte.\n\nEin undatiertes Foto, das offenbar in Frankreich aufgenommen wurde: Ghislaine Maxwell küsst Jeffrey Epstein (†66) auf die Wange und schließt dabei verliebt die Augen\n\nGhislaine Maxwell ringt mit Model-Agent\n\nVom Herumtollen mit Prominenten bis hin zu anzüglichen Posen – Ghislaine Maxwell zeigt mit ihrem pädophilen Finanzier-Freund das pralle Leben. Heute verbüßt sie eine 20-jährige Haftstrafe wegen ihrer Rolle bei der Anwerbung und dem Handel mit Minderjährigen für Sex im Auftrag von Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAuf einem Foto ist die grinsende Maxwell zu sehen, wie sie mit dem französischen Modelagent Jean-Luc Brunel auf einem Sofa ringt. Offenbar an Bord eines Privatflugzeugs.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell ringt auf einer Fell-Decke mit dem französischen Model-Agenten Jean-Luc Brunel (†75) und leckt an seinem Ohr. Rechts ist der Fuß eines weiteren Mannes zu sehen, vermutlich Epstein\n\nWährend einer Fußmassage für Jeffrey Epstein zeigt Ghislaine Maxwell lachend ihre Brüste\n\nAnzügliche Gesten und Posen\n\nDer enge Vertraute des verstorbenen US-Finanziers wurde später wegen des Verdachts der Vergewaltigung und des Handels mit Minderjährigen verhaftet, bevor er 2022 in seiner Gefängniszelle in Paris erhängt aufgefunden wurde.\n\nAuf einem anderen Foto aus der selben Serie zieht Maxwell ihr weißes Trägertop herunter und entblößt teilweise ihre Brust, während eine andere Person außerhalb des Bildausschnitts ihren Fuß zwischen ihre Brüste legt. Weitere, bereits bekannte Fotos aus der Serie belegen, dass es sich hierbei um Jeffrey Epstein handelt.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell hat vor dem ehemaligen Supermodel-Agenten Jean-Luc Brunel ihre Zunge herausgestreckt. Er packt sie grinsend von hinten an den Haaren\n\nMaxwell beantragt Aufhebung ihres Urteils\n\nDie neuesten veröffentlichten Bilder erscheinen, nachdem Maxwell am Mittwoch, nur 48 Stunden vor der erwarteten Veröffentlichung der Epstein-Akten, offiziell bei einem Bundesgericht beantragt hat, ihre Verurteilung wegen Sexhandels aufzuheben.\n\nMaxwell behauptete, dass „wesentliche neue Beweise aufgetaucht sind“, die zeigen, dass sie keinen fairen Prozess erhalten habe, wie aus den von „ABC News“ eingesehenen Unterlagen hervorgeht.\n\nEin undatiertes Foto zeigt Star-Magier David Copperfield (heute 69) mit Ghislaine Maxwell kuschelnd im Bademantel in luxuriöser Umgebung\n\nMaxwell schrieb: „Diese neu verfügbaren Beweise zeigen, dass entlastende Informationen zurückgehalten, falsche Aussagen gemacht und wesentliche Tatsachen gegenüber der Jury und dem Gericht falsch dargestellt wurden.“\n\nDer Antrag ist Maxwells letzter verzweifelter Versuch, einer weiteren Inhaftierung zu entgehen, nachdem sie alle direkten Rechtsmittel ausgeschöpft hat.",

        "content": "Building in regulated industries adds a massive hurdle to the already challenging journey of building a startup. And this week on Build Mode, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen spoke to two founders who are working to make progress in industries ripe for disruption, despite the regulatory headaches that might have deterred many other people.\n\nIn this episode, we’re talking about life and death and how regulatory clearance doesn’t have to be a damper on innovation but it will elongate timelines and require careful planning from the jump.\n\nIsabelle is first joined by Gabriel Sanchez, the CEO and co-founder of Enspectra Health. The company has built a device that aims to do away with the need for dermatologist skin biopsies. Sanchez breaks down his decade-long journey to receiving FDA clearance. Throughout the interview, Sanchez offers tactical advice to anyone in the midst of a long regulatory process and explains how he’s kept his company afloat and his team motivated despite the uncertainties.\n\nNext, Isabelle speaks with Tom Harries, the co-founder of Earth Funeral, an end-of-life startup that has developed a new process that transforms human remains into soil. Harries didn’t have to lead his team through a long FDA approval process (because the FDA is primarily concerned with the living), but his company has faced its own legislative challenges. Earth Funeral launched at a time when its alternative process was only legal in one state. And though its path to expansion doesn’t hinge on accreditation or approval from a government agency, it does depend on legislative bodies and voters who may be discomforted by a new way to lay a loved one to rest.\n\nNew episodes of Build Mode drop every Thursday. Subscribe to the podcast or watch on YouTube. Isabelle Johannessen is our host. Build Mode is produced and edited by Maggie Nye. Audience Development is led by Morgan Little. And a special thanks to the Foundry and Cheddar video teams.",

        "summary": "Expertos advierten que la propuesta incurre en una concentración de mercado que puede afectar la competitividad en el sector de bajo costo",
        "content": "La intención de Volaris y Viva Aerobus de formar un solo grupo mexicano de empresas bajo una estructura de sociedad controladora puede afectar la competencia en el mercado de aerolíneas de bajo costo, de acuerdo con analistas consultados por EL UNIVERSAL.\n\nLas aerolíneas aseguran que el objetivo de crear una holding, es decir, una compañía matriz que controla ambas mediante la propiedad de sus acciones, pero dejándolas operar independientemente, tiene como meta aumentar los viajes aéreos a precios bajos, colocar capital para crecer y eficientar sus costos. Sin embargo, se puede crear una concentración que afecte la competencia y eleve las tarifas al consumidor en las rutas donde compiten actualmente.\n\n“Desde el punto de vista de la regulación de competencia económica o antimonopolios, que precisamente busca que haya competencia en mercados abiertos como el de la aviación, para lograr mejor calidad en el servicio y tarifas más competitivas para beneficio del usuario, esto califica claramente como una concentración que necesariamente requerirá de la autorización de la nueva Comisión Nacional Antimonopolio”, dijo Juan Carlos Machorro, abogado líder de la Práctica Transaccional del despacho Santamarina y Steta.\n\nLee también: Suben acciones de Volaris tras anuncio de alianza con Viva Aerobús; \"despegan\" 17% en la BMV\n\nLa Unión hace la fuerza. Fuente: Agencia Federal de Aviación Civil\n\nEn su opinión, lo primero que debe analizar la comisión es delimitar el mercado relevante en el que se desempeñan ambas aerolíneas para ver cuál es el impacto de la concentración.\n\n“Tienen más de 40% de participación del mercado de la aviación, el doble de lo que tiene Aeroméxico, que es más o menos 20%, es un porcentaje considerable y enciende los focos rojos de una autoridad en materia de competencia económica para aprobar o no una fusión de este tipo”, expuso.\n\n“Pero si se considera el mercado de las aerolíneas de bajo costo, son los únicos dos jugadores, porque ya no existe Interjet, y ese 40% se convierte en 100% del mercado de bajo costo”, detalló Machorro.\n\nLee también: Volaris y Viva anuncian creación de nuevo Grupo Mexicano de Aerolíneas; buscan acelerar conectividad y mantener bajos costos\n\nAdemás, se debe revisar si hay traslapes en las rutas hacia las ciudades donde vuelan, porque se pueden convertir en la única compañía que opere cierto destino.\n\n“Se acaba la competencia”\n\nEn tercer lugar, indicó que la Comisión Antimonopolio deberá revisar qué tan competitivas son o no las tarifas que ofrecen los dos agentes económicos frente a otros que participan en el mercado.\n\n“Se acaba la competencia entre las aerolíneas de bajo costo y se corre el riesgo de que, no obstante lo que dicen ahorita, dejen de ser empresas de bajo costo y habría, por lo menos, la tentación de subir tarifas si efectivamente las tarifas que está manejando Aeroméxico son más altas que las de ellos”, agregó.\n\nLee también: Viva Aerobús y Aeroméxico amplían oferta internacional; Monterrey suma vuelos a Nueva York y París\n\nVolaris y Viva afirman que esta unión les permitirá tener mayores economías de escala a través de su nuevo grupo de aerolíneas, se beneficiarían de menores costos de propiedad de la flota, mejor acceso a capital y una posición financiera más sólida.\n\n“Esto permitirá a ambas aerolíneas expandir su oferta de servicios de bajo costo y alta calidad, haciendo que los viajes aéreos sean más accesibles para un grupo más amplio de pasajeros, con el objetivo de expandir el alcance del mercado y estimular la demanda”, indicaron.\n\nEn la mira de EU\n\nLa unión tendrá que ser analizada por las autoridades antimonopolios tanto en México como en Estados Unidos.\n\nJonathan Félix, analista del sector aéreo en Verum, dijo que la intención de ambas aerolíneas es permanecer con costos bajos, además, no compiten entre ellas en varias rutas, pues casi 40% de las que opera Volaris no tienen competencia, igual Viva.\n\nDonde quizá pudiera haber un impacto es en rutas hacia ciudades de alta densidad como México, Guadalajara, Tijuana o Cancún, pero eso se verá con el tiempo.\n\nLee también: VIDEO: Reportan que piloto \"secuestró\" avión en el AICM para exigir que le pagaran; autoridades inician investigación\n\n“Si ellos cumplen con lo que dijeron, es positivo en el sentido de dar vuelos más baratos, pero sólo el tiempo lo dirá”, comentó Félix.\n\nViva y Volaris detallaron que la estructura de holding les permite conservar sus marcas únicas y operaciones actuales bajo sus certificados de operación independientes, manteniendo las opciones existentes para los pasajeros y aumentar sus viajes punto a punto.\n\nNecesitan la aprobación de la Comisión Nacional Antimonopolio y la de Inversión Extranjera en México; de la Ley Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) antimonopolio en Estados Unidos, y de la agencia antimonopolio colombiana. Se espera que la transacción se cierre en 2026.\n\nLee también: EU reitera alerta aérea sobre Venezuela; advierte deterioro de la seguridad\n\nPara los empleados se promete ",

        "content": "The Assemblée Nationale, during debates over the social security budget bill, in Paris, on December 16, 2025. DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP\n\nFor Christmas, the political menu will be the same as in December 2024: a bit meager, with no budget and just a bare-bones \"special law\" as a substitute. After a joint parliamentary committee, tasked with reaching a compromise on a budget bill for 2026, failed in its mission on Friday, December 19, the government acknowledged that it would be impossible to have a budget bill adopted and signed into law before year's end. It is therefore preparing to present an alternative to lawmakers: a so-called \"special law,\" which aims to prevent the state's complete financial shutdown.\n\nThe process is expected to be swift. France's highest administrative court, the Conseil d'Etat, has been asked to review the bill, and will have to issue its legal opinion at record speed. The bill could then be examined by the cabinet over the weekend, then by MPs on Monday and senators on Tuesday, before being signed into law immediately afterwards.\n\nTime is of the essence. At the end of 2024, then-outgoing prime minister Michel Barnier's caretaker government presented a draft special law to a cabinet meeting on December 11. The bill was only minimally amended by the Assemblée Nationale, unanimously adopted by both MPs and senators in less than a week and signed into law by President Emmanuel Macron on December 20. This year, the process is starting about 10 days later, but the final deadline remains the same: Everything must be done to ensure that the state does not shut down at midnight on December 31.\n\nYou have 71.77% of this article left to read.

        "content": "\n\n\n\nDonald Trump sparked laughter and surprise at a North Carolina rally on Friday when he went off-topic to talk about his wife and first lady Melania's undergarments.The MAGA chief was addressing inflation and efforts to lower drug prices ahead of the 2026 midterm elections in Rocky Mount, but turned to a personal topic about the FBI raid on his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022.“They went into my wife's closet ... they looked at her drawers,” Trump said, referring to Melania.The GOP leader then said: “Her undergarments, sometimes referred to as panties, are folded perfect, wrapped. They're, like, so perfect.” He even joked about her maintenance habits, saying, “I think that she steams them.”The comments came in the context of the 2022 Mar-a-Lago raid. The operation was conducted as part of a criminal investigation after the National Archives and Records Administration reported that 15 boxes of presidential documents had been removed from the property at the end of Trump’s first term. The FBI aimed to find evidence related to potential obstruction of justice, mishandling of classified records, and possible violations of the Espionage Act. Among the materials recovered were 11 sets of classified documents, including some marked \"top secret,\" intended for secure government facilities only.Trump has faced a lot of legal setbacks over the past decade. In June 2023, he was indicted by a federal grand jury over alleged mishandling of classified documents. He pleaded not guilty and while additional counts were later added, the case was dismissed in July 2024. Other high-profile legal issues include investigations into alleged hush money payments during the 2016 presidential campaign, and his role in attempts to overturn the 2020 election and the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",

        "content": "El Departamento del Tesoro de Estados Unidos anunció este viernes nuevas sanciones contra personas vinculadas al chavismo, entre ellas familiares directos de la primera dama de Venezuela, Cilia Flores, y del empresario panameño Ramón Carretero. La medida se inscribe en la estrategia de presión de Washington sobre el Gobierno de Nicolás Maduro, que avanza en distintos frentes.\n\nLa Oficina de Control de Activos Extranjeros (OFAC) incluyó en la lista de sancionados a personas relacionadas con Carlos Malpica Flores, sobrino de Cilia Flores, quien fue reincorporado al régimen de sanciones la semana pasada. Se suman ahora Eloísa Flores de Malpica, madre de Malpica Flores y hermana de la primera dama; Carlos Evelio Malpica Torrealba, su padre; Iriamni Malpica Flores, su hermana; Damaris del Carmen Hurtado Pérez, su esposa; y Erica Patricia Malpica Hurtado, su hija adulta.\n\nEl Departamento del Tesoro afirma que las sanciones se basan en la presunción de que los señalados participaron directa o indirectamente en transacciones corruptas con el Estado venezolano o en proyectos y programas gubernamentales.\n\n“Hoy, el Tesoro sancionó a individuos que apoyan al narco-Estado deshonesto de Nicolás Maduro. No permitiremos que Venezuela siga inundando nuestra nación con drogas letales”, afirmó el secretario del Tesoro, Scott Bessent. Añadió que “Maduro y sus cómplices criminales amenazan la paz y la estabilidad de nuestro hemisferio” y que la Administración Trump continuará atacando a las redes que respaldan lo que calificó como una “dictadura ilegítima”.\n\nLas sanciones también alcanzan a familiares del empresario panameño Ramón Carretero, señalado por Washington de realizar negocios con el chavismo y con la familia Maduro-Flores. En la lista figuran sus hermanos Roberto y Vicente Luis Carretero Napolitano, cuyos bienes y cuentas en Estados Unidos quedan bloqueados.\n\nMalpica Flores había sido retirado de la lista de sancionados en 2022, en el marco de negociaciones entre Caracas y la Administración de Joe Biden. El sobrino de la primera dama fue tesorero nacional y desempeñó un papel clave en la gestión de la estatal petrolera PDVSA. Ese mismo año, Estados Unidos liberó a otros dos sobrinos de Cilia Flores —Efraín Antonio Campo Flores y Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas—, condenados en 2017 en Nueva York a 18 años de prisión por narcotráfico, tras ser detenidos en Haití durante una operación encubierta de la DEA. Ambos fueron excarcelados en un intercambio por prisioneros estadounidenses, pero la semana pasada volvieron a ser sancionados junto con su primo.\n\nDesde 2008, más de 275 personas vinculadas al chavismo —entre funcionarios civiles y militares, empresarios y operadores comerciales— han sido sancionadas, principalmente por Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea, además de países como Canadá, Reino Unido, Panamá y Suiza. Las nuevas medidas coinciden con recientes declaraciones del secretario de Estado, Marco Rubio, quien reiteró las acusaciones sobre presuntos vínculos del Gobierno de Maduro con actividades criminales. “En el caso de Venezuela es muy simple: es un régimen ilegítimo que coopera abiertamente con Irán, con Hezbollah y con grupos narcotraficantes, incluidas las guerrillas del ELN y las FARC, que operan dentro del territorio venezolano”, afirmó.\n\nRubio sostuvo que estas alianzas convierten al Gobierno venezolano en un factor de desestabilización regional y en un facilitador de actividades que amenazan la seguridad de Estados Unidos. “La amenaza más grave para Estados Unidos en el hemisferio occidental proviene de grupos criminales terroristas transnacionales, centrados principalmente en el narcotráfico. Hay un lugar que no coopera, y es el régimen ilegítimo de Venezuela”, declaró este viernes en una rueda de prensa.",

        "title": "Deaths of despair were rising long before opioids",
        "summary": "Long before opioids flooded communities, something else was quietly changing—and it may have helped set the stage for today’s crisis. A new study finds that as church attendance dropped among middle-aged, less educated white Americans, deaths from overdoses, suicide, and alcohol-related disease began to rise. The trend started years before OxyContin appeared, suggesting the opioid epidemic intensified a problem already underway.",
        "content": "A new study suggests that falling participation in organized religion among middle-aged white Americans with lower levels of education may have contributed to the rise in so-called \"deaths of despair.\" These deaths include fatalities linked to drug overdoses, suicide, and alcoholic liver disease.\n\nThe researchers found a clear pattern at the state level. States that experienced the sharpest drops in church attendance between 1985 and 2000 also saw the largest increases in deaths from these causes during the same period.\n\nA Trend That Began Before the Opioid Crisis\n\nDeaths of despair are often associated with the arrival of OxyContin and other powerful opioids in the late 1990s. However, the new analysis indicates that the upward trend started earlier, at the same time religious participation began to decline.\n\n\"What we see in this study is the beginning of the story, before opioids became a major issue, and it shows rises in deaths of despair were already beginning to happen when the opioid crisis hit,\" said Tamar Oostrom, co-author of the study and an assistant professor of economics at The Ohio State University.\n\nOostrom worked on the research with Tyler Giles of Wellsley College and Daniel Hungerman of the University of Notre Dame. The study was published online in the Journal of the European Economic Association.\n\nData Sources and Affected Populations\n\nThe research team combined survey data on religious involvement from the General Social Surveys with mortality records from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTheir findings showed that the decline in religious participation was concentrated among white, middle-aged adults without a college degree. This was the same group that experienced the most pronounced increases in deaths of despair, Oostrom said.\n\nThe relationship between lower church attendance and higher mortality appeared consistently across genders and was seen in both rural and urban areas of the United States.\n\nBlue Laws and Changes in Church Attendance\n\nTo strengthen their findings, the researchers examined the repeal of \"blue laws,\" which had previously restricted many businesses from operating on Sundays. These laws limited competition with church attendance by reducing alternative activities.\n\nA major wave of repeals took place in 1985, when Minnesota, South Carolina, and Texas eliminated their blue laws. The researchers compared outcomes in those states with others that did not make similar changes at that time.\n\nThe analysis showed that repealing blue laws led to a 5- to 10-percentage-point drop in weekly attendance at religious services. In later years, those same states also experienced higher rates of deaths of despair.\n\nMortality Trends Before and After Opioids\n\nOostrom noted that deaths of despair among middle-aged white Americans had been steadily declining from the late 1970s through the early 1990s. That decline eventually stalled, a shift that aligns with both falling church attendance and the repeal of blue laws.\n\nAfter OxyContin was introduced in 1996, mortality rates rose sharply.\n\n\"OxyContin and the opioid crisis made a bad situation worse, but the deaths of despair were already on the rise,\" Oostrom said.\n\nWhy Churchgoing May Matter for Health\n\nThe study raises an important question: how could lower church attendance contribute to higher death rates?\n\nOostrom explained that people who stop attending religious services often lose social ties, which past research has shown play a crucial role in physical and mental health. However, the findings suggest that social connection alone does not fully explain the pattern.\n\nThe researchers did not observe similar declines in other types of social activities during the same period when church attendance was falling.\n\n\"Religion may provide some way of making sense of the world, some sense of identity in relation to others, that can't easily be replaced by other forms of socialization,\" Oostrom said.\n\nShe also emphasized that belief itself did not fade during the years studied.\n\n\"What changed is whether people identified as religious and whether they go to church. Those are the things that matter when it comes to deaths of despair,\" she said.\n\nCan Community Participation Reverse the Trend?\n\nThe findings raise the possibility that renewed involvement in religious organizations or even secular community groups might help counter rising mortality rates. However, the authors caution that existing evidence does not offer much optimism.\n\n\"To our knowledge, findings on this point have so far been pessimistic,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nOostrom added that there is no clear sign that broader declines in community participation are reversing. She also noted that the positive effects of religious involvement on life satisfaction are difficult to reproduce through other forms of social engagement.\n\nThe growing role of social media in the 21st century may further reduce the likelihood of a meaningful reversal, she said.\n\n\"People are le",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size\n\nWhen a country is traumatised, leadership can be as simple as a hug. Nearly 30 years after the Port Arthur massacre, one of the defining images of the harrowing days which followed that tragedy is of John Howard embracing Dr Bryan Walpole, an emergency surgeon exhausted from attending to the wounded and the dead.\n\nThere was a tentativeness in the body language of Howard as he put his arm around the Hobart doctor – still wearing his white lab coat – on the cathedral steps of a memorial service. There was none from Dr Walpole, who buried his anguished face in the shoulder of the then-prime minister.\n\nAnthony Albanese is a more instinctive hugger than Howard and a man more open with his emotions. Within hours of the mass shooting at Bondi Beach, he urged us to wrap our arms around the Jewish community. At a time when Jewish Australia and much of the nation is grieving for those murdered, the prime minister would have been a natural fit for the role of consoler-in-chief.\n\nInstead, there is a coldness and a distance between Albanese and the family and friends of the Bondi victims. There is also a deep rift, unmended by the prime minister’s delayed, full-throated commitment to addressing antisemitism four days after the Bondi killings, between Albanese, his government, the Australian Labor Party and Jews who for the past two years asked for them to do more to stop the hate.\n\nThe father of the youngest of the Bondi victims, a 10 year-old-girl named Matilda who was shot dead as she was celebrating the first night of Hanukkah with her family on the beach, did not spare Albanese an ounce of his anger or his grief. “He failed Matilda,” he said of the prime minister.\n\nLabor has a Jewish problem. If this wasn’t clear before Bondi, it is now. It runs much wider than the prime minister’s office and deeper than the normal partisan divide which cleaves nearly every issue in Australian public life. Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Peter Wertheim, asked to characterise the problem, is succinct: “It’s a moral paralysis.”\n\nThis is criticism from a friend. Sydney-based Wertheim, the son of an Auschwitz survivor, has an enduring relationship with Albanese. The pair famously campaigned together 24 years ago to stop the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions Movement from taking root at Marrickville Council in Albanese’s Sydney electorate and since then, have retained a mutual trust and respect.\n\nDoes he believe Albanese when the prime minister vows to eradicate antisemitism? “Nobody does. In his own mind, he is emotionally committed to that. But I think he is struggling. The nation is struggling, because the depth of evil we saw on Sunday is so far beyond the range of Australian life and experience.”\n\nInside the ALP, Jewish people who have dedicated much of their working lives to the party are dismayed, not just at the horrific events at Bondi, but how Labor has responded to a growing crisis within their community since October 7, 2023.\n\nJohn Howard hugs Dr Bryan Walpole in the days after the Port Arthur massacre. Credit: Rick Stevens\n\n“There is a very clear perception within the Jewish community that Labor governments, both state and federal, have not done enough to combat not just antisemitism but the normalisation of hate speech,” says Phil Dalidakis, a former minister in Victoria’s Andrews government. Michael Danby held the federal seat of Macnamara for Labor in Melbourne’s inner south, before current MP Josh Burns, for 21 years. “The cumulative effect of their policies is to create an atmosphere where people feel vulnerable,” he says.\n\nOn the night after the Bondi killings, this sense of vulnerability was palpable as Jews interrupted Hanukkah celebrations to attend impromptu vigils and community gatherings. In Melbourne, Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan, after chairing a meeting of cabinet, directed all of them to join her that night at the Caulfield Shule, in the middle of the city’s bagel belt, to demonstrate their solidarity.\n\nThe premier and ministers were cordially greeted as they arrived at the shule, a modern orthodox synagogue, a little after 7pm. Congregants shook their hands and thanked them for coming. But once everyone was seated and Zionism Victoria president Elyse Schachna formally announced Allan’s attendance, her presence was loudly jeered and booed. When Josh Burns was announced, they booed him as well. All the Liberal names dropped, including new Victorian Opposition Leader Jess Wilson, received enthusiastic applause.\n\nA man seated in the pew behind me remarked it felt more like a football crowd than a congregation. This was a tribal rejection of federal and state Labor.\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan is spoken to by a Jewish community member at the Caulfield Shule while Deputy Prime Mini",

        "content": "Reuters —\n\nThe man suspected of carrying out an attack in Taiwan with a smoke grenade and knife acted alone, police said on Saturday of the incident that killed four, including the attacker.\n\nChang Wen, 27, from the northern city of Taoyuan, died falling from a building during a police chase on Friday evening in a packed shopping district in central Taipei, police said.\n\n“Based on relevant verification work carried out continuously since yesterday, we have not found that the suspect had any other accomplices,” National Police Agency Director-General Chang Jung-hsin told reporters.\n\nInvestigations are ongoing as to the motive, he said.\n\nPremier Cho Jung-tai said late on Friday that the man had been the subject of an arrest warrant, wanted for suspected evasion of Taiwan’s compulsory military service.\n\nEleven people were injured in the attack, of whom two are in intensive care, the health ministry said.\n\nChang Wen let off smoke bombs at Taipei’s main train station, then made his way to a mall at a nearby subway station, attacking people both inside the shopping center and on his way there, police said.\n\nViolent crime in Taiwan is very rare, and in response to the attack the police presence has been stepped up across the island, including in the bustling capital Taipei.\n\n“For areas in Taipei city where crowds are expected to gather in various commercial districts, we are upgrading security measures citywide,” Mayor Chiang Wan-an told reporters. “This includes not only increasing the police presence but also ensuring that all officers are fully equipped with the necessary gear.”\n\nPresident Lai Ching-te, who visited some of the injured in hospital on Saturday morning, wrote on his Facebook page that the government would learn the lessons from this incident.\n\n“We will also ensure that rapid-response units can be mobilized immediately when emergencies occur, so as to safeguard public safety,” he said.",

        "content": "New coach Pete Golding says he is reminding younger Ole Miss players what the CFP and a first-round matchup vs. Tulane means to seniors like quarterback Trinidad Chambliss. (2:40)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nWhen No. 6 Ole Miss takes the field Saturday against No. 11 Tulane in a College Football Playoff first-round game, the Rebels will be led by first-time head coach Pete Golding, whose only activity on X since January 2023 has been dropping a shark emoji every so often.\n\nAt least the 41-year-old former defensive coordinator is predictable.\n\nThat wasn't always the case with Lane Kiffin, the former Ole Miss coach who abruptly left the Rebels at the end of the regular season to take over SEC rival LSU. Kiffin seems to spend as much time on social media as he does residing in opposing defensive coordinators' heads because of his unpredictable playcalling.\n\nThat isn't the only difference between the former colleagues turned rivals.\n\n\"I'm not changing who I am,\" Golding said during his first session with reporters after being named Kiffin's replacement. \"I ain't changing what the hell I wear. I'm [not] going to yoga ... I ain't doing any of that s---. I am who I am.\"\n\nThe once-shaggy-haired Golding did get a haircut after replacing Kiffin and has been more polished in news conferences, according to local reporters. But he's still sporting a beard and visor and sometimes has tobacco in his lip. The former Delta State safety remains as competitive as ever as well.\n\n\"You don't know me well, but I don't care if I'm coaching football or playing my wife in tennis,\" Golding said. \"Like, I'm trying to whip your ass, all right?\"\n\nIn the 19 days since taking over the Rebels, Golding has worked hard to convince his players that the postseason isn't about him -- or Kiffin. That didn't always seem to be the case under Kiffin, especially not while he was not-so-quietly being courted simultaneously by Florida and LSU for weeks.\n\n\"I think this group is focused on the mission, not the man,\" Golding said.\n\nStill, as Ole Miss prepares to host what is being billed as the biggest sporting event in the state's history at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, it's going to be difficult to completely forget Kiffin, who guided the Rebels to the first 11-win regular season in school history.\n\nThe Rebels are still running Kiffin's offense, which led the SEC with 498.1 yards per game and was third with 37.3 points.\n\nCollege Football Playoff Bracket Challenge Fill out up to TWO College Football Playoff Brackets!

However, they've returned to Ole Miss to coach in the CFP.\n\nNearly all of the Rebels' defensive staff remains intact and plans to stay with Golding in 2026; Kiffin's brother, Chris, was the team's linebackers coach and went with him to LSU.\n\nGolding, a former defensive coordinator at UTSA and Alabama, welcomed Weis and the others back to finish the job they started -- even if they'll be coaching at one of the Rebels' biggest rivals in 2026.\n\nGolding compared the situation to splitting with a girlfriend, then reuniting with her. Yet even celebrity breakups aren't as public and messy as Lane Kiffin's departure from Ole Miss was.\n\n\"Obviously, like in any situation, you break up with your girlfriend and you get back, you're kind of looking around and you're looking at things that you probably didn't look at before, and you're probably noticing some things that were there before, right?\" Golding said.\n\nKiffin had wanted to continue coaching the Rebels in the CFP even after he informed Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter on Nov. 29 that he was leaving for LSU. Carter and chancellor Glenn Boyce had made it clear to Kiffin that he wouldn't be allowed to coach Ole Miss in the postseason if he accepted a job offer elsewhere.\n\nSources told ESPN that Kiffin warned his assistants that if they didn't leave with him, they wouldn't have jobs at LSU.\n\nStill, Ole Miss officials wanted Cox, McDonald and Weis to return to give the Rebels their best chance at winning a CFP national championship.\n\n\"I think the big thing from our players, at any level -- D-II, Division I, the NFL -- they want to be in a room with guys that create value for them,\" Golding said. \"Getting you prepared to play really well, whether it's individually, as a group or as a unit. When you get back to a routine, you are doing it with the same guy that got you to 11-1. Where he's going to be in January really doesn't matter.\"\n\nBut that doesn't mean the LSU-Ole Miss rivalry has cooled down. Kiffin took general manager Billy Glasscock to Baton Rouge, so Golding hired Austin Thomas, who was Brian Kelly's general manager at LSU.\n\nOn Tuesday, sources confirmed to ESPN that Golding is also hiring LSU interim coach Frank Wilson as ",

In the Rams' first loss of the season, 33-26 to the Eagles, Los Angeles had its final two offensive possessions end with blocked kicks.\n\nIn the Rams' Week 10 victory over the Saints, kicker Joshua Karty missed an extra point and a 39-yard field goal attempt. After the game, McVay said the Rams' special teams issues \"can't continue like this.\"\n\nLos Angeles replaced long-snapper Alex Ward with Jake McQuaide and Karty with Mevis, who had not missed a kick until Thursday night in Seattle.\n\nBlackburn, 42, was in his third season as the Rams' special teams coordinator. A former linebacker for the Giants and Panthers, he also has worked as an assistant with Carolina and Tennessee.",

        "summary": "Bugonia — in theaters nationwide October 31st — from director Yorgos Lanthimos gets at the heart of what makes this age of conspiracy theories bleak.",
        "content": "is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.\n\nWe live in an age where it has become infinitely easier for people to lead lives that are wholly divorced from any semblance of reality. Conspiracy theories run rampant, science denial is en vogue, and there is a vast media ecosystem filled with charlatans encouraging others to “do their own research” instead of believing well-educated experts. It can be hard to see anything funny about a world where it often feels like the capitalist powers that be are hell-bent on speedrunning society into a new dark age of anti-intellectualism. But Bugonia — Yorgos Lanthimos’ new remake of South Korean director Jang Joon-hwan’s Save the Green Planet! — is a masterful example of why, sometimes, you really do just have to laugh at how utterly batshit things are right now.\n\nThough Bugonia cleaves very closely to the original story it’s adapted from, the new film shifts its details just enough to make it feel like Lanthimos and screenwriter Will Tracy have crafted a uniquely American tale about the dangerous allure of conspiracy theories. The feature shapeshifts with an impressive, Parasite-esque nimbleness that keeps each of its narrative modes — comedy, body horror, psychological thriller — in constant focus. Just when you think that Bugonia can’t get any more grueling or heartbreaking, its story plunges into new depths of stomach-turning dread. But for all of its darkness, Bugonia is also funny as hell, and its lead performances are nothing short of tremendous.\n\nSet in a small US town that’s been impacted by the opioid crisis, Bugonia revolves around disgruntled fulfillment center worker Teddy Gatz (Jesse Plemons). Like many of his neighbors, Teddy spends his days toiling for a megacorporation that views its employees as faceless cogs as opposed to people with hopes and dreams. Teddy would much rather spend his time tending to his small, backyard farm of bees, but he needs his hourly gig to take care of Don (Aidan Delbis), his trusting cousin. Life is simple and dreary for the pair, who live together in a dilapidated home by a forest near the city’s outskirts. But Teddy — a conspiracy theorist who spends hours inhaling unhinged YouTube videos — has a plan to turn their lives around.\n\nIt is hard for Don to make sense of Teddy’s rants about pharmaceutical CEO Michelle Fuller (Emma Stone) being a disguised alien from the Andromeda galaxy. But Don loves his cousin, which makes it easy for him to accept the strange diatribes. As Teddy tells it, Michelle is actually an emissary who has been sent to Earth on a mission to destroy humanity by way of decimating the planet’s population of pollinating bees. And Teddy is certain that if he and Don kidnap Michelle and chain her up in their basement, they can convince her to arrange a meeting with her emperor during an upcoming lunar eclipse.\n\nIt is clear that Teddy is deeply unwell as he explains how shaving Michelle’s hair and covering her body in drugstore ointment are necessary steps to keep her from contacting her mothership and confusing her captors with potent alien pheromones. But Bugonia spends much of its runtime exploring what sorts of things make it possible for people to become so unmoored from reality. The film presents both Teddy and Don — a duo whose dynamic strongly echoes elements of Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men — as examples of ordinary men who feel abandoned by society. They need a singular figure to project their fears and anger onto because the structural forces that have truly marginalized them are too large to comprehend.\n\nIn contrast to Plemons, who brings Teddy to life with a flighty and twitchy griminess, Stone inhabits her character with a media-trained sharpness that makes you understand how someone might be able to see her as a monstrous person. Teddy’s insistence that he has enough experience hunting and dissecting “aliens” to know that Michelle is lying about being human is disconcerting on its face. But Stone plays her role with such calculating (and captivating) straightness that you’re soon left wondering whether she does actually have something to hide from the cousins.\n\n(L to R) Aidan Delbis as Don, Jesse Plemons as Teddy and Emma Stone as Michelle. Image: Focus Features\n\nEspecially during one of Stone’s early monologues where she explains how the public might respond to a high-profile pharma executive or a governor suddenly disappearing, Bugonia feels like commentary at least partially inspired by recent real-world events. The cousins aren’t exactly vaccine deniers, but Teddy does believe that they need to shoot up with special drugs to prevent others from tampering with their minds.\n\nBugonia constantly highlights the objective absurdity of what’s going on with lingering shots of a bald, ointment-smeared Stone styled to resemble Max Schreck’s Count Orlok, and a countdown of title cards tha",

        "content": "\n\n\n\nNewly released files linked to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have again implicated former US President Bill Clinton, after photographs surfaced showing him nearly naked in a hot tub with an unidentified woman, who social media speculates could be Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's close associate.The images were made public as part of a Justice Department document release, which was ordered last month to ensure transparency, with a 30-day deadline for a full disclosure. However, the revelation was only partial, with most information redacted or blacked out.The files were released on Friday to meet a congressionally mandated deadline, including numerous photographs and records involving Clinton (79). One image shows him reclining in a hot tub with a woman at his waist. Others place him alongside Epstein on private planes, at overseas destinations and at high-profile events and parties.“This is his reckoning. I mean, if you turn on CNN, that’s what they are talking about. I’ve gotten a million texts about it,” Clinton's former aide said, according to AOL.He added: “People are like, ‘I can’t believe he was in a hot tub.Who’s the woman in there?’ She’s at, you know, body level. I mean, it’s, like, unbelievable. It’s just shocking.”The records show Clinton travelling with Epstein to the UK, Brunei, Thailand and Morocco. He is also pictured attending the 2002 wedding of Moroccan King Mohammed VI, as well as touring Winston Churchill’s Second World War war room in London. In another image, Clinton is seen swimming with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking crimes in a low-security prison.The former aide said that Clinton's life is now ruined: “[Clinton] is Prince Andrew… He’s kinda done. He was already done before, but now he’s even more so. People have to be brought to justice for if they did these things, there’s no question about it.”The document dump was criticised by Democrats who said that the Justice Department failed to fully comply with the transparency law. The files contain relatively few references to President Donald Trump, who was once friendly with Epstein before cutting ties around 2004. The DOJ has denied any allegations of removing or editing names, saying they did so to protect the privacy of victims and not to hide the names of predators.Clinton’s office denied any wrongdoing and accused political opponents of deflecting attention. “The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” a Clinton spokesperson said.Lawmakers who authored the Epstein Transparency Act, including Ro Khanna, Shri Thanedar and Thomas Massie, said the Justice Department failed to release all required materials and is breaking the law.Far-right activist Laura Loomer posted on X: \"It’s pretty rich how the Democrats falsely accused President Trump of being a pedophile, only for the Trump DOJ to release Epstein files that show Bill Clinton skinny dipping with a pedophile in the pedo’s pool\"Clinton was not the only one featured in the newly released files. There were also pictures of Michael Jackson, Kevin Spacey, Mick Jagger, and Diana Ross with Epstein.",

        "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nHey, folks! Every week for the past four years, the team behind Verge Deals has combed the web, looking for the best deals and discounts on the tech we love most at The Verge. We pride ourselves in having tried and tested every product we recommend — well, almost every product — and we continue to share those deals with our readers via our daily deal coverage and Verge Deals newsletter. That being said, everyone could use a little change every now and again.\n\nNo, Verge Deals is not going away — quite the contrary, actually. We’ve given our newsletter a fresh coat of virtual paint to reflect our new(ish) colors and design language, and we plan to continue to deliver a fresh batch of deals to your inbox every Friday afternoon. This time, though, we’re incorporating guest dispatches from the larger Verge staff, more personal gift recommendations, and more subscriber exclusives.\n\nWe’ll still highlight steep price drops on Verge-approved favorites like the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro and Sony’s WH-1000MX5 headphones, as well as other recs culled from our expert reviews and buying guides. We’ll even tell you how you can land limited-edition tech that’s likely to sell out — including Sony’s forthcoming PlayStation 5 Pro.\n\nIf you don’t already subscribe to Verge Deals, you can sign up for free using the box below. We’re going to keep the weekly cadence (for now), but you can expect bimonthly special sends in the run-up to Amazon’s next Prime Day event, Black Friday, and the holiday shopping season.\n\nKeep an eye on your inbox this afternoon for the first issue of the new and improved Verge Deals, and if you’re curious about The Verge’s full slate of both free and premium newsletters, head over to our newsletter hub to sign up for Command Line, Installer, and Notepad. We’re excited about the changes in the coming months. We hope you are, too.",

        "summary": "France's public debt has now reached €3.482 trillion, the national statistics bureau announced on December 19. It stands at 117.4% of GDP, a record level outside times of war or pandemic. With no sign of fiscal recovery, analysts have warned that a market crisis cannot be ruled out.",
        "content": "Emmanuel Macron, in western France, on November 4, 2025. AGNES DHERBEYS/MYOP FOR LE MONDE\n\nIt came as a stark warning, like an alarm sounding through the corridors of the Assemblée Nationale to remind MPs of the real critical issue at hand. At the same time as 14 lawmakers gathered, as a joint parliamentary committee, in search of a compromise on the state budget bill that ultimately was not found, the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) published on Friday, December 19, the total of France's public debt. In just three months, the debt had risen by another €65.9 billion, reaching €3.482 trillion at the end of September. Could this financial time bomb still be defused? Beyond the fate of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu's government, the debt was the real issue at stake in the budget negotiations.\n\nThis dangerous escalation has been continuing for 50 years now. Over that half-century, the French state, local authorities and the social security system have spent more than they collect in revenue. Every budget has been in deficit since 1975. To cover the gap, the country has kept borrowing more and more.\n\n\"It's not just exceptional or investment spending that is funded by borrowing, but the day-to-day operation of the state and transfer payments linked to redistribution or social security,\" said economist Guillaume Hannezo in a recent memo for the think tank Terra Nova. The debt is like \"a consumer loan which covers weekly expenses and does nothing to prepare for the future,\" said Nicolas Dufourcq, head of Bpifrance, France's public investment bank, in La Dette Sociale de la France, 1974-2024 (\"France's Social Debt, 1974-2024\").\n\nYou have 75.44% of this article left to read.

        "content": "The Justice Department released thousands of files related to sex offender and accused sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in a much-anticipated document dump Friday.\n\nThe documents are the result of Congress forcing the Trump administration’s hand. The administration had initially promised extensive disclosures on Epstein but then, in July, abruptly changed course. Congress ultimately last month passed a bill requiring the administration to release the files, after a bipartisan revolt.\n\nThe documents are not everything the Justice Department has; it said Friday it will continue rolling them out in the coming weeks. But they give us our biggest glimpse to date of what the administration initially decided not to release.\n\nThe batch of documents appears, at least after early reviews, to include no smoking guns and relatively few major revelations.\n\nBelow are some takeaways from what we learned.\n\n1. The administration failed to follow the law, likely seeding more suspicion\n\nAfter months of the administration stepping on its own toes and making it look like it had something to hide, it did itself few favors with its rollout.\n\nFor one, the Justice Department didn’t release all the documents, as was required by the deadline Friday, 30 days after Congress passed its law.\n\nAnd secondly, the documents carried extensive redactions — and for more reasons than the law prescribed. The redactions were also inconsistent, with the same content being redacted in one instance but not in another.\n\nIn some cases, the redactions included whole pages and even whole documents, as was the case with 119 pages of grand jury testimony.\n\nDemocrats cried foul, as did Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, who helped lead the Epstein discharge petition effort. The Kentucky Republican said the document dump “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.”\n\nA few key points: it was a tough deadline — 30 days to comb through thousands of documents and, in some cases, redact sensitive information. There is also no enforcement mechanism in the law, so it’s not clear what recourse Congress could have. (Two Democrats on key committees said they would examine “all legal options.”)\n\nBut the administration didn’t do much to warn everyone that it would fail to meet the deadline — at least until Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s Fox News appearance on Friday morning.\n\nAnd these things are unlikely to help the administration from a political standpoint. After all, it’s already lost plenty of trust with its handling of the files. And as many as 7 in 10 Americans thought the government had hidden information about Epstein, according to a Reuters-Ipsos poll earlier this month.\n\n“This just shows the Department of Justice, Donald Trump, and Pam Bondi are hellbent on hiding the truth,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.\n\nThe problem with conspiracy theories is that they’re difficult to fully extinguish. Even if the administration had followed the law and released everything Friday, there would likely have been suspicions about things it held back or redacted.\n\nBut it’s given people plenty of reason to be suspicious about its commitment to transparency. And we can now add this to the list.\n\nBill Clinton, Ghislaine Maxwell and an unidentified person whose face has been redacted are seen in this undated photo released by the Justice Department as a part of the release of the Epstein Files, on Friday, December 19, 2025. Department of Justice\n\n2. A heavy dose of Clinton\n\nThe documents that were released Friday, while only partial, featured a heavy dose of former president Bill Clinton. And the administration took great care to point that out.\n\nThere were a number of never-before-released pictures of Clinton.\n\nBut perhaps the most notable ones showed Clinton in water next to someone whose face was redacted. A Justice Department spokesman, Gates McGavick, in a post on X identified someone in a hot tub with Clinton as a “victim.”\n\n(It’s worth noting that the Justice Department says it didn’t just redact victims.)\n\nSeveral White House officials also pointed to the pictures. And the White House in its statement alluded to “Epstein’s Democrat friends.” It’s clear this was a point of emphasis.\n\nClinton’s connections to Epstein and travel on Epstein’s plane have been well-known, and Clinton has never been accused by law enforcement of wrongdoing related to Epstein. Indeed, Trump White House chief of staff Susie Wiles was quoted by Vanity Fair just this week saying Trump was “wrong” to link Clinton to potential criminal activity with Epstein.\n\nClinton spokesman Angel Ureña pointed to Wiles’s comment. He said the administration’s focus on Clinton amounted to “shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they’ll try and hide forever.”\n\n(It’s worth noting that Trump has been tied to one of Epstein’s victims, though he has denied any wrongdoing and has not been accused by law enforcement of it. Emails released by Epstein’s estate showed ",

BENOIT TESSIER / REUTERS\n\nThe French government warned protesting farmers against erecting blockades during the festive season on Friday, Decembre 19, while unions were divided over further tactics in a standoff over a cow disease.\n\nFor more than a week, farmers in the southwest of the country have staged protests against a mass cull of cows to contain the spread of nodular dermatitis, widely known as lumpy skin disease. They have blocked roads, sprayed manure and dumped garbage in front of government offices to force the authorities to review their mass slaughter policy.\n\nThe farmers have also been angered over a trade deal under negotiation between the European Union and South American bloc Mercosur, which was this week postponed to January. On Friday, farmers staged a protest in the northern resort city of Le Touquet, placing a coffin outside the residence of French President Emmanuel Macron. In the northern town of Alençon, a protester threw red paint in front of a public building.\n\nRead more Subscribers only EU-Mercosur deal divides France's agricultural sectors\n\nRepresentatives of farmers' unions were received by Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu on Friday, but their leaders were divided over the next course of action. After the meeting, the hardline Coordination Rurale (CR), which has been spearheading the protests together with the Confédération Paysanne union, stopped short of calling for a Christmas truce and the removal of the roadblocks.\n\nCR head Bertrand Venteau said it would be up to union leaders on the ground to decide what to do next, but nevertheless asked the protesting farmers to \"go and rest\" for several days. \"The population is behind us, we can't alienate them,\" said Venteau. He suggested there was \"a glimmer of hope\" that a solution could be found in early January to put an end to the mass slaughter of herds.\n\nConfédération Paysanne also indicated there was hope of coming to agreement. But spokesperson Stéphane Galais said the union could not \"call for the blockades to be lifted\" without a commitment to stop a mass cull.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Bovine skin disease: Massive vaccination campaign pits some farmers against veterinarians\n\nOn Friday, government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon said the authorities would not \"tolerate new blockades\" during the holiday season. Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez called for farmers \"to act responsibly.\" \"The priority for us is really to avoid new blockades of major roads,\" he said. \"Many of our fellow citizens are going on vacation.\"\n\nHelp us improve Le Monde in English Dear reader, We’d love to hear your thoughts on Le Monde in English!

Take the survey\n\nThe head of the main FNSEA union, Arnaud Rousseau, called for a \"truce,\" saying the prime minister planned to send a letter to the unions by Friday evening. The Young Farmers union backed the call for a Christmas truce. While many roadblocks were still in place, the first blockades were lifted on Friday afternoon.",

        "summary": "El Madrid gana escaso de fútbol y liderado por un portero que salva puntos. Mbappé iguala de penalti el récord de Cristiano. El Sevilla merece más incluso con diez por expulsión de Marcao",
        "content": "Mostrar comentarios 68\n\nHubo récord de Mbappé, que igualó los 59 goles de CR7 en año natural y lo celebró con el 'siuuu'. Y tiene pinta de que Xabi Alonso disfrutará del respiro navideño sin más sobresaltos, pero no despejó duda alguna. Es más, aumentaron, con un juego cansino, plomizo, y una fragilidad defensiva que asusta. El Sevilla, liderado por Alexis, pudo repetir la hazaña del Celta pero le faltó tino en el remate y le sobró la inspiración de Courtouis, la figura de la noche navideña. El belga regaló el turrón a su entrenador sin mucha complicidad de sus compañeros, faltos de tensión. Ganó el Madrid, y contó esta vez con el beneficio de un mal arbitraje de Muñiz Ruiz, desacertado desde la expulsión de Marcao. Le tuvo que corregir el VAR en dos penaltis mal señalados, a favor del Madrid.\n\nEl Madrid del primer tiempo recordó al del día del Celta. Es más, empezó peor, especialmente por el sector de Huijsen y Fran García, en diez minutos le ganaron la espalda Isaac, Alexis y Juanlu. No se distingue el Sevilla por su elaboración, pero detectó la debilidad y generó tres acciones de gol muy claras. Sobre todo la de Romero, que se escapó junto al poste. Primeros pitos de la grada. A los jugadores, que conste.\n\nXabi Alonso se vistió para la ocasión con sus mejores galas. La BMV más Rodrygo en la derecha. Se entregó a sus figuras, y no recibió mucho a cambio salvo la intención de Goes. Bellingham arrancó en la base de la jugada para ir escorándose a la izquierda. Mejoró en participación, sin exagerar. Justo es consignar que el Madrid tuvo una opción clara tras un gran pase de Goes, pero Fran García no precisó el control y Odysseas le tapó el mano a mano. También hay que subrayar que Mbappé se fumó los dos primeros balones potables que le llegaron, así que desde el principio no hubo duda del objetivo que perseguía. Mal asunto priorizar un número individual por encima del triunfo colectivo.\n\nLo lógico cuando se enfrentan dos equipos cortos de fútbol es que decidan las individualidades. Rebasada la media hora, poco después de que Agoumé hubiera fallado al remate tras rebasar a Güler sin despeinarse, Marcao midió mal en una entrada lateral y se jugó algo más que la amarilla. Botó Rodrygo templadito y Bellingham, desde atrás, cabeceó cruzado a la red. Gol de llegador puro. Hiló antes del descanso un buen ataque el Madrid que acabó con caída de Rodrygo, sin contacto aparente. Lo vio el árbitro y le sacó amarilla. La grada recordó a Negreira y la corrupción, sin fundamento. Pero antes de la pausa, y con una entrada de Rodrygo a Marcao de alto riesgo, tiró Alexis una chilena (lo natural, claro) tras una acción mal defendida y dejó claro que no costaba mucho al Sevilla hacer daño.\n\nNo volvió tras la pausa Almeyda a su recuadro, expulsado en el túnel de vestuarios. El Madrid presionó con timidez y aceptó un intercambio de golpes que le pudo salir muy caro. Porque sumó otras tres opciones claras el Sevilla, a la espalda de los centrales, descoordinados y poco efectivos. Salvó Courtois ante Alexis primero y por dos veces ante Romero, todas de mérito. Mientras, Mbappé se obcecaba buscando el gol. Lo rozó en una acción muy suya, desde la izquierda, con quiebro hacia dentro y tiro cruzado que se fue por poco. Y también en un cabezazo cercano que se fue a la cruceta. Punteó Odysseas. Nada.\n\nEl partido quedó desequilibrado por una imprudencia de Marcao en el centro del campo. Entró a Bellingham destemplado, aunque no hubo mucho contacto. Segunda amarilla que no encajó bien el defensor sevillista, recordando la de Rodrygo al final de la primera parte.\n\nCon panorama favorable, frente a diez, el Madrid fue a peor. Dejó de correr, de disputar balones. La grada pidió que le echaran coraje, pero era cuestión de intención, de juego, de ser un equipo. Porque con diez jugadores, Alexis al frente, sacó los colores a un Madrid sin alma. Tanto era el desasosiego que Xabi Alonso no paraba quieto en la banda. Decidió sustituir a Vinicius, que se ganó una pitada soberana. Será útil si la interpreta como debe.\n\nEntró Gonzalo, pero quien decidió fue Rodrygo al arrancar desde el costado de Vini y sacar el penalti clamoroso de Juanlu. No hubo duda ahí. Lanzó Mbappé, impecable, y lo celebró a lo Cristiano en claro homenaje al portugués, su ídolo. Pese al 2-0, y con triple cambio, el equipo hispalense siguió insistiendo, con Peque y Alfon bulliciosos. Hubo tiempo aún desde el 84' para que Muñiz Ruiz, sin control, pitara dos penaltis para el Madrid que no eran y que le corrigió el VAR. Acabaron encendidos los sevillistas por el sainete arbitral. Pero también acabaron enfadados los madridistas por lo que ofrece su equipo. No se adivinan signos de mejora. Tiempo de revisión.",

        "summary": "The incident marks the second time in recent weeks that the US has seized an oil tanker near Venezuela.",
        "content": "The incident marks the second time in recent weeks that the US has seized an oil tanker near Venezuela.\n\nThe United States seized an oil tanker that was last docked in Venezuela, according to US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\n“The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,” Noem wrote on X on Saturday.\n\nThe US Coast Guard apprehended the vessel before dawn with support from the Pentagon, she added.\n\nThe incident occurred just days after US President Donald Trump announced a blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.\n\nThis is the second time in recent weeks that the US has seized a tanker near Venezuela, and it comes amid a large US military buildup in the region as Trump continues to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nAdam Clements, a former US diplomat and Pentagon official, told Al Jazeera that it is yet to be seen whether the US administration’ actions to put pressure on Maduro will produce results.\n\nHe reminded that President Trump’s administration already talked about “stemming the flow of drugs and focusing on the Western Hemisphere”, adding that Washington also “hinted at regime change”.\n\nSharp fall in exports\n\nIn the days since US forces seized the first sanctioned oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast last week, there has been an effective embargo in place, with loaded vessels carrying millions of barrels of oil staying in Venezuelan waters rather than risking seizure.\n\nSince the first seizure, Venezuelan crude exports have fallen sharply.\n\nWhile many vessels picking up oil in Venezuela are under sanctions, others transporting the country’s oil and crude from Iran and Russia have not been sanctioned. Some companies, particularly the US’s Chevron, transport Venezuelan oil in their own authorised ships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, which accounts for about 4 percent of its imports, with shipments in December on track to average more than 600,000 barrels per day, analysts have said.\n\nFor now, the oil market is well supplied, and there are millions of barrels of oil on tankers off the coast of China waiting to offload.\n\nIf the embargo stays in place for some time, then the loss of nearly a million barrels a day of crude supply is likely to push oil prices higher.\n\nTrump’s pressure campaign on Maduro has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near Venezuela, which have killed at least 100 people.\n\nTrump has also said that US land strikes on the South American country will soon start.\n\nMaduro has alleged that the US military buildup is aimed at overthrowing him and gaining control of Venezuela’s oil resources, which are the world’s largest crude reserves.\n\nOn Saturday, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned Trump against an “armed intervention in Venezuela”, saying that it “would be a humanitarian catastrophe”.\n\nAt a summit of the South American Mercosur bloc in Foz do Iguacu, a city in southern Brazil, Lula repeated his stance against the US’s actions towards Venezuela in a stronger statement, stressing that it would be a “dangerous precedent for the world”.\n\nMore than four decades after the Falklands War, between Argentina and the United Kingdom, he added, “The South American continent is once again haunted by the military presence of an extra-regional power.”",

        "content": "Todo lo tenía a favor María Guardiola cuando convocó las elecciones: la inercia alcista del PP, el desplome demoscópico del PSOE, la oportunidad de desbloquear unos Presupuestos que bloqueaba Vox, el mensaje de estabilidad como eje central, la escasa pujanza del resto de candidatos... y, sobre todo, el procesamiento del líder del PSOE extremeño, Miguel Ángel Gallardo, por enchufar presuntamente al hermano del presidente del Gobierno desde su cargo de presidente de la Diputación de Badajoz.\n\nTodo, incluso la campaña, jugaba a favor de la candidata del PP. En los primeros compases de la recta final hacia las urnas, Guardiola logró que el foco se pusiera en el «desbloqueo» de la gobernabilidad. Mientras, el PSOE se enfangaba en sus casos de presunto acoso sexual y en Vox estallaba la crisis de la organización juvenil Revuelta. Las encuestas, primero, y los trackings, después, marcaban una tendencia alcista del PP que les hacía soñar en secreto con la carambola de la mayoría absoluta. Que era y es muy difícil, pero no imposible. Pero una última semana de campaña algo errática ha desdibujado esos sueños. «Teníamos la mayoría absoluta en los deditos y la hemos perdido por errores absurdos», asegura un miembro de la campaña que no entiende que Guardiola rechazase ir al debate televisivo de RTVE del jueves, ni que la candidata popular se pasase de frenada diciendo, tras el robo de una caja fuerte que contenía 14.000 euros y 124 votos en una oficina de Correos, que «nos están robando la democracia».\n\nLa sensación entre los populares extremeños consultados es que el resultado de Guardiola será «muy bueno», pero, al tiempo, se quedan con la duda de si habrían logrado algo más «si ella hubiera sido ella misma» en la recta final de la campaña. Les pesa la idea de seguir dependiendo de Vox -si se cumplen los sondeos-, pero reconocen que siempre fue ése el escenario principal: depender de Vox, sí, pero consolidando el giro a la derecha en una comunidad tradicional del PSOE, ganando las elecciones (en 2023 Guardiola quedó segunda, empatada a diputados con los socialistas) y sumando más escaños que toda la izquierda. De manera que sólo fuera necesaria la abstención de la formación de Santiago Abascal para garantizar la gobernabilidad.\n\nAlberto Núñez Feijóo, en conversación informal con la prensa durante la copa de Navidad del PP, aseguró ayer que la clave es que su partido va a pasar de estar empatado con el PSOE a distanciarse notablemente: «Le vamos a sacar 10 puntos al PSOE, y todos van a subir menos el PSOE», resumió. A su juicio, que el PP pueda superar el 40% de voto «en una tierra tan de izquierdas como Extremadura» es algo «inaudito».\n\n¿Y no le habría gustado a Feijóo que Guardiola hubiera pisado el acelerador en la recta final de la campaña, yendo al debate televisivo nacional y haciendo más actos? «El candidato sabe cuál es su estrategia y su objetivo», y a él le parece que las entrevistas de Guardiola en dos periódicos extremeños han «aplacado» el impacto regional de ese debate.\n\nFeijóo le resta importancia al órdago de Vox: cree que Abascal no se atreverá a pedir la cabeza de Guardiola si esta gana y la formación de ultraderecha queda en tercer lugar. También cree que Vox deberá permitir la gobernabilidad si los populares sacan más diputados que toda la izquierda junta. Y opina que el PP extremeño no tendrá que ceder tanto como cedió el PP valenciano, porque su situación es muy distinta y precisamente lo que busca es desbloquear una legislatura que había encallado.",

        "content": "French lawmakers adopted a social security budget bill and suspended France's pension reform at the Assemblée Nationale, in Paris, on December 16, 2025. DIMITAR DILKOFF / AFP\n\nA joint parliamentary committee of French lawmakers failed to reach a compromise on the state budget for next year, parliamentary sources said on Friday, December 19, making it unlikely that France will have a 2026 budget bill by year's end. The 2025 budget is now likely to be carried over into the new year, as debates continue in both chambers.\n\nFrance, the eurozone's second-largest economy, is under pressure to rein in its deficit and soaring debt, but efforts have been hampered by political deadlock. Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has pledged to produce an austerity budget by year's end, without using a constitutional power to ram the bill through without a vote, as had been done in previous years.\n\nIn a win for Lecornu, on Tuesday, lawmakers narrowly adopted the social security budget bill, another part of the government's broader spending plan, postponing an unpopular pension reform until 2028.\n\nRead more Subscribers only French PM Lecornu's budget bet starts to pay off\n\nYet they still have to pass a state budget bill, which has been complicated by a tug of war between the right-leaning Sénat, which wants to cut spending, and the lower house, in which the left has demanded more revenue measures.\n\n'Special law'\n\nThe government is now likely to push for parliament to vote on a so-called \"special law\" to temporarily carry over the 2025 budget plan into the new year while debates continue. That vote could happen as soon as Monday.\n\nThe special law would allow the state to continue collecting taxes after January 1, effectively enabling it to keep paying civil servants' salaries, as well as pensions.\n\nYet central bank governor François Villeroy de Galhau warned, on Friday, that this was only a short-term solution. If France kept its 2025 budget into the next year, it would lead the country to a \"deficit far higher than desired,\" he told the radio station France Inter.\n\nRead more Subscribers only France, in political crisis, risks having no budget\n\nPolitical gridlock also previously delayed the adoption of France's 2025 budget bill, with a spending plan being approved in February after then-prime minister François Bayrou forced it through the lower house.",

        "content": "I never thought I would share this, but here I am. I was writing a lot of code, a bunch of scripts, i.e small files, to do stuff. I hated VS Code, after getting acquainted with vim, and i hated vim after getting cozy with neovim. But then, the diminishing returns started to plateau. Neovim is fun, but it's too much to work with sometimes. VS Code is too heavy to work on small files, i.e open it close it open it close it again bla bla. In all this, another option grew appealing to me, the nano text editor.\n\n\nThat's when I decided to write something between nano and neovim. All I wanted from neovim was the ability to register shortcuts and support for plugins. Therefore, I tried to merge the best of both worlds by making an editor that is pleasant to work with.\n\n\nUsing C, was fun, at least mostly. A lot of new experience dealing with lower level details, threads, and the likes. Really transformed the way I think about code, I suggest everyone else to try C.\n\n\nMy code editor is called light, or HolyCode(after Terry Davis, or a stab at VSCode). I hope you guys like it,\n\n\nhttps://github.com/thisismars-x/light",

        "summary": "Cyclist and road safety groups argue proposed alternative route away from traffic-free Le Piétonnier is unsafe",
        "content": "On an unseasonably mild winter’s day, people are gathering at Le Piétonnier, the pedestrian zone in the heart of Brussels. Tourists buy mulled wine and churros at the Christmas market outside the Bourse, the old stock exchange, now repurposed as a beer museum. A few people drink coffee on cafe terraces. Up and down the length of the 650-metre-long space, people come and go, bikes and scooters weaving in and out of the crowds.\n\nNext year, this scene will look somewhat different: bikes and scooters will be banned from this 18,000-sq-metre pedestrian zone for most of the day. People on two wheels will be allowed to ride only between 4am and 11am. At all other times, they must dismount and push their vehicle up the street, or face a fine.\n\nAnaïs Maes, the city counsellor in charge of urban planning and mobility, suggested not all cyclists obeyed the existing 6km speed limit. “In everyday reality, people do not respect that rule or don’t know it, and so it creates conflicts.”\n\nMaes, a member of the Dutch-speaking socialist Vooruit party, is aware of “small accidents” and complaints from pedestrians. “I’ve heard multiple persons say, especially older persons or persons with little kids, or persons with reduced mobility, [that] they don’t feel safe, because they live in fear of not being able to step aside quickly enough or being hit.”\n\nBrussels officials have not decided exactly when the change will enter into force, as negotiations within the council over implementation are ongoing.\n\nIn a sense, the Brussels Piétonnier is a victim of its own success. Extended a decade ago to make the city greener, calmer and cleaner, it transformed a swathe of the centre from a traffic-clogged, four-lane road into a place for walkers, strollers and cyclists, revitalising cafe terraces and open-air gatherings. It was a transformative shift for a city that had long suffered from its mid-20th-century love affair with the car.\n\nFor instance, the Grand-Place, the magnificent central square, with intricate, gold-leaf-adorned guildhalls and gothic city hall, was effectively a car park until 1972 and traffic was not banned entirely from the square and its cobbled environs until 1991.\n\nView image in fullscreen Danielle Peeters: ‘I think it is a little radical.’ Photograph: Jennifer Rankin/The Guardian\n\nThe decision to extend the pedestrian zone in 2015, by banning cars from a large shopping area around Place de La Bourse was controversial initially. Maes, who was not on the council at the time, said idealistic planners believed that pedestrians and cyclists could share the space. “The city of Brussels had this idea: we were creating a space that’s multimodal and everyone will find their place; I think it is sad but in reality it doesn’t always work and then you have to find solutions.”\n\nDanielle Peeters, a cyclist, who works at a Dutch-language association, thinks the ban is a shame. “I think it is a little radical,” she says, having just parked her bike outside a ramen bar. “When there are a lot of people, obviously I slow down, but there are some people who cycle very, very quickly.”\n\n“Alex”, a 43-year old mountain climbing guide from Ukraine, who works as a takeaway courier and gave a pseudonym, says it will cause him difficulties because he will not be able to pick up deliveries, although referencing war in Ukraine, he said there were bigger problems. “For me it’s not a big issue, but they could have done a better job painting pathways for bikes.”\n\nThat is the point for local cycling safety groups. The conflict between cyclists and pedestrians, some say, was a story foretold in the decision not to create a dedicated bike lane.\n\nAn open letter by a dozen cyclist and road-safety groups published in December denounced the ban as “dangerous and absurd”, arguing that the city’s proposed alternative route for cyclists – three streets running parallel to the pedestrian zone – was not safe.\n\nOn this alternative route, bikes share the busy roads with cars, buses and coaches; cycle groups say there are many blind spots and drivers, who flout the ban on overtaking cyclists.\n\nView image in fullscreen Cycle groups are worried about safety issues on the proposed alternative route. Photograph: Jennifer Rankin/The Guardian\n\nBernards Heymans, the president of Heroes for Zero, a grassroots road safety movement, said the proposed alternative route was “not comfortable” and even dangerous, especially for child cyclists.\n\n“If cyclists are banned on the Piétonnier, then we would really like a real second way to access the city centre for cyclists,” he said. “If we find a second way that is totally secure, of course, everybody will go through the second way.”\n\nMaes does not think a separate bike lane in the pedestrian zone is the answer. “It doesn’t increase safety, because when every mode has its own designated space [cyclists] go faster,” which can also create conflicts with pedestrians crossing that lane, she said.\n\nShe was working hard, she said, to cr",

        "summary": "The bill will require large AI developers to publish information about their safety protocols and report safety incidents to the state within 72 hours.",
        "content": "Governor Kathy Hochul has signed the RAISE Act, positioning New York as the second U.S. state to enact major AI safety legislation.\n\nState lawmakers passed RAISE Act in June, but following lobbying from the tech industry, Hochul proposed changes to scale the bill back. The New York Times reports that Hochul ultimately agreed to sign the original bill, while lawmakers agreed to make her requested changes next year.\n\nThe bill will require large AI developers to publish information about their safety protocols and report safety incidents to the state within 72 hours. It will also create a new office within the Department of Financial Services to monitor AI development.\n\nIf companies fail to submit safety reports or make false statements, they can be fined up to $1 million ($3 million for subsequent violations).\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed a similar safety bill in September, which Hochul referenced in her announcement.\n\n“This law builds on California’s recently adopted framework, creating a unified benchmark among the country’s leading tech states as the federal government lags behind, failing to implement common-sense regulations that protect the public,” Hochul said.\n\nState Senator Andrew Gounardes, one of the bill’s sponsors, posted, “Big Tech thought they could weasel their way into killing our bill. We shut them down and passed the strongest AI safety law in the country.”\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nBoth OpenAI and Anthropic expressed support for New York’s bill while also calling for federal legislation, with Anthropic’s head of external affairs Sarah Heck telling the NYT, “The fact that two of the largest states in the country have now enacted AI transparency legislation signals the critical importance of safety and should inspire Congress to build on them.”\n\nNot everyone in the tech industry has been so supportive. In fact, a super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman is looking to challenge Assemblyman Alex Bores, who co-sponsored the bill with Gounardes. (Bores told journalists, “I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it.”)\n\nThis comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that directs federal agencies to challenge state AI laws. The order — backed by Trump’s AI czar David Sacks — is the latest attempt by the Trump Administration to curtail states’ ability to regulate AI, and will likely be challenged in court.\n\nWe also discussed Trump’s executive order, and the role that Sacks and a16z have played in opposing state AI regulation, on the latest episode of the Equity podcast.",

        "summary": "The director of “Deepfaking Sam Altman” created a “Sam Bot” when he couldn’t get an interview with the OpenAI CEO. Watch an exclusive trailer for the documentary, which comes out in January.",
        "content": "Director Adam Bhala Lough didn’t set out to make a documentary about a digital simulacrum of Sam Altman.\n\nBut after about 100 days of texting and emailing the OpenAI CEO for an interview—with no response, he claims, and with financiers hounding him to make good on his original pitch—Lough was at his wit’s end.\n\nHe’d exhausted just about every angle. “Once I reached that point, I gave up and I pivoted to gate-crashing OpenAI,” he says. Though he’d employed a similar tactic in his Emmy-nominated 2023 documentary Telemarketers—a chronicle of industry-wide corruption in the telemarketing business—it wasn’t a filmmaking style he felt all that comfortable with. “It was a fortress. I was able to slip through the gate, and immediately security grabbed me and physically removed me from the premises.”\n\nSo begins Deepfaking Sam Altman, Lough’s portrait of how AI is reshaping society and his quest to talk to the man behind it. When his original plan fell through he drew inspiration from Altman himself. “The Scarlett Johansson controversy erupted,” he says. In 2024, the actress publicly called out OpenAI for seeming to copy her voice for its new AI voice assistant Sky. “It was at that point where I got the idea to do the deepfake.” (In a May 2024 statement, Altman apologized to Johansson and said Sky’s voice was “never intended to resemble” hers.)\n\nWhat originally starts out as a simple voice clone balloons into a full deepfake of Altman called Sam Bot, which Lough travels to India to have created. This being a Lough film, though, nothing goes according to plan. Without spoiling too much, Sam Bot eventually becomes its own entity, and the film takes an even stranger—and revelatory—dive from there. “There's parallels between this movie and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, but there's none of the violence,” he says. Lough grew up during what he calls the “AI 1.0 era.” His obsession with James Cameron’s Terminator 2 was a major influence on his craft.\n\nDeepfaking Sam Altman, which is based partially on the New York Magazine story casting Sam Altman as the Oppenheimer of our age, features commentary from former OpenAI safety engineer Heidy Khlaaf, who tells Lough, “We're starting to see OpenAI dip its toes in military uses, and I cannot imagine something like Dall-E and ChatGPT being used for military assists. That really scares me, given how inaccurate those systems are.\"",

        "content": "La operación llega después de que la semana pasada el ejército se incautara de otro barco sancionado por Washington y a los pocos días de que Trump anunciara un “bloqueo total y completo”\n\nEstados Unidos ha interceptado y confiscado este sábado la carga de un buque petrolero con bandera panameña en aguas internacionales, frente a las costas de Venezuela. Es el segundo barco apresado después de otra operación similar del 10 de diciembre. La información la adelantó Reuters, que citó a tres funcionarios, y la confirmaron después otros medios estadounidenses.\n\nLa noticia llega después de que el presidente Donald Trump anunciara esta semana un “bloqueo total y completo” para todos los petroleros sancionados por Washington que entran y salen del país sudamericano. Con ese anuncio, el republicano despejó las pocas dudas que podían quedar sobre el interés de Washington en el petróleo como parte de la ofensiva contra el Gobierno de Nicolás Maduro, que venía justificando únicamente como una guerra como el narcotráfico que ya ha superado el centenar de asesinatos extrajudiciales de tripulantes de supuestas narcolanchas.\n\nLos funcionarios estadounidenses citados anónimamente por Reuters no precisaron el lugar de la operación; tampoco el nombre del barco. Sí especificaron que la Guardia Costera estaba al mando. The New York Times publicó después, con más fuentes anónimas, que el barco se llama Centuries, que pertenece a una empresa china y que no forma parte de la lista de petroleros sancionados por Estados Unidos.\n\nDesde que el ejército estadounidense, en un alarde propio de una película de acción, se apoderó la semana pasada de Skipper, un petrolero sancionado frente a las costas venezolanas, un embargo de facto se ha impuesto sobre el comercio energético de Caracas.\n\nVenezuela lleva años, a la manera de Rusia e Irán, recurriendo a lo que se conoce como la “flota fantasma” para eludir las severas sanciones impuestas por Washington a su industria petrolera. Con esa armada de barcos obsoletos logra seguir suministrando crudo a sus clientes.\n\nPese a las amenazas de Trump de “bloqueo total”, los petroleros han seguido saliendo de Venezuela, algunos de ellos escoltados por barcos militares. Al menos tres de grandes dimensiones zarparon en los últimos días.\n\nEl Gobierno de Nicolás Maduro ha dicho esta semana que piensa mantener sus compromisos de despachar unos 700.000 barriles diarios a China, su principal cliente. Pese a esa promesa, las exportaciones de crudo venezolano han caído drásticamente, según apunta Reuters, desde la incautación del Skipper, que navegaba con falsa bandera guyanesa y 1,9 millones barriles a bordo. La crisis en el Caribe ya ha tenido su impacto en un alza del precio del barril y en el desvío de buques que se dirigían a la zona.\n\nLas sanciones de 2019\n\nDesde 2019, cuando Estados Unidos impuso las primeras sanciones petroleras contra Venezuela, el país sudamericano se pasó al mercado negro de crudo, donde imperan las operaciones con pocas garantías y la obligación de ofrecer grandes descuentos, que se han incrementado con el aumento de la oferta de crudo sancionado por las restricciones impuestas a la producción rusa e iraní.\n\nEl 40% de los buques que llegan a puertos venezolanos están sancionados y operan con falsas banderas y las señales de navegación apagadas para no ser detectados, según un análisis de Transparencia Venezuela. Más de 75 embarcaciones relacionadas con Caracas han sido sancionados por Estados Unidos en los últimos años.\n\nEsta semana, el Departamento del Tesoro incluyó 29 petroleros de Irán, aliado del chavismo en materia energética como proveedor de productos derivados del petróleo para la producción de combustible. Si bien muchos buques que transportan petróleo desde Venezuela están sujetos a sanciones por parte de Washington, hay otros que no lo están, y compañías como la estadounidense Chevron sigue moviendo petróleo con sus propios buques autorizados desde puertos venezolanos.\n\nTrump acusa al chavismo de “robar” a Estados Unidos y le hace responsable de la expropiación de empresas petroleras estadounidenses, especialmente durante el Gobierno de Hugo Chávez. El bloqueo continuará, promete el republicano, hasta que Venezuela devuelva “todo el petróleo, la tierra y otros activos que previamente robaron”.\n\nTrump hacía referencia en el mensaje en Truth en el que anunció el bloqueo a las confiscaciones de los activos de ExxonMobil y Conoco Phillips, así como de los de las compañías de perforación petrolera Halliburton, Schlumberger y Baker Hughes, entre 2007 y 2009.\n\nStephen Miller, asesor de Seguridad Nacional de Trump y una de las figuras claves de su gabinete, se remontó aún más, hasta la nacionalización de la industria petrolera venezolana en 1976: “El sudor, ingenio y esfuerzo estadounidenses crearon esa industria. Su despótica expropiación fue el mayor robo de riqueza y propiedad estadounidense del que hay recuerdo. Estos activos saqueados fueron usados para financiar el terror",

        "title": "This “mushroom” is not a fungus, it’s a bizarre plant that breaks all the rules",
        "summary": "Balanophora is a plant that abandoned photosynthesis long ago and now lives entirely as a parasite on tree roots, hidden in dark forest undergrowth. Scientists surveying rare populations across East Asian islands uncovered how its cellular machinery shrank but didn’t disappear, revealing unexpected similarities to parasites like malaria. Some island species even reproduce without sex, cloning themselves to colonize new habitats. This strange survival strategy comes with risks, leaving the plant ",
        "content": "In the damp shade beneath moss-covered trees, high in the mountains of Taiwan and mainland Japan or deep within the subtropical forests of Okinawa, an unusual organism quietly grows. At first glance, it resembles a mushroom. In reality, it is a plant called Balanophora, and it possesses some of the smallest flowers and seeds known in the plant world.\n\nUnlike most plants, Balanophora contains no chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It also lacks a conventional root system to draw water from the soil. Instead, it survives entirely by attaching itself to the roots of specific nearby trees and stealing the nutrients it needs. Some species and populations take this strangeness even further by producing seeds without fertilization -- a reproductive strategy that is extremely rare among plants.\n\nScientists uncover the secrets of a long-mysterious plant\n\nThe genus Balanophora takes its name from its acorn-like appearance (Greek: balanos, acorn; phoros, bearing), and it has puzzled scientists for generations. Because the plant is rare and restricted to highly specific habitats that are increasingly threatened by human activity, most research has been limited to isolated populations.\n\nThat is now changing. A collaborative team from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Kobe University, and the University of Taipei has conducted a broad survey of Balanophora across its scattered and hard-to-reach habitats. Their findings, published in New Phytologist, trace the plant's evolutionary history, reveal how its internal structures have adapted to a parasitic lifestyle, and open new doors for future research into this unusual lineage.\n\nAs study lead author Dr. Petra Svetlikova, Science and Technology Associate at OIST, explains: \"Balanophora has lost much of what defines it as a plant, but retained enough to function as a parasite. It's a fascinating example of how something so strange can evolve from an ancestor that looked like a normal plant with leaves and a normal root system.\"\n\nShrinking plastids and life without photosynthesis\n\nParasitic plants often undergo dramatic internal changes as they become more dependent on their hosts. One common trend is the reduction or loss of plastids -- a category of plant organelles that includes chloroplasts, which enable photosynthesis in most plants.\n\nEven though Balanophora relies completely on its host trees for nutrition, the researchers found that it has not eliminated its plastids. Instead, these structures have been pared down to a minimal form. While non-parasitic plants may use up to 200 genes to build and maintain plastids, Balanophora retains only about 20. Despite this extreme reduction, more than 700 proteins are still transported into these plastids from the surrounding cell, indicating that they continue to perform essential functions.\n\nProfessor Filip Husnik, head of the Evolution, Cell Biology, and Symbiosis Unit at OIST, notes the surprise of this discovery. \"That Balanophora plastids are still involved in the biosynthesis of many compounds unrelated to photosynthesis was surprising. It implies that the order and timing of plastid reduction in non-photosynthetic plants is similar to other eukaryotes, such as the malaria-causing parasite, Plasmodium, which originated from a photosynthetic ancestor.\"\n\nAn ancient lineage shaped by islands\n\nBy examining samples from many different populations, the team reconstructed the evolutionary tree of Balanophora and traced how it spread across subtropical regions of East Asia. The plant belongs to the family Balanophoraceae, one of the oldest known groups of fully parasitic plants.\n\nThis family began diversifying during the mid-Cretaceous period, roughly 100 million years ago -- making it one of the earliest land plant lineages to abandon photosynthesis entirely.\n\nReproduction without sex and the risks of survival\n\nBalanophora's reproductive strategies are just as unusual as its appearance and lifestyle. Reproductive methods vary widely between species and even between populations. Some require fertilization to produce seeds, while others can also reproduce without fertilization, a process known as facultative agamospermy. In the most extreme cases, some species are obligately agamospermous, meaning they never reproduce sexually at all.\n\n\"Obligate agamospermy is exceedingly rare in the plant kingdom, because it typically carries a lot of negative downsides -- lack of genetic diversity, accumulation of bad mutations, dependence on specific conditions, higher extinction risk, and so on,\" says Dr. Svetlikova. \"Fascinatingly, we found that the obligately agamospermous Balanophora species were all island species -- and we speculate that more Balanophora species may be facultative, or even obligate, agamosperms.\"\n\nOne advantage of this reproductive approach is that a single female plant can establish a new population after reaching an island. This ability allows Balanophora to spread quickly into the narrow ",

        "summary": "An online marketplace is selling code modules that simulate the effects of cannabis, ketamine, cocaine, ayahuasca, and alcohol when they are uploaded to ChatGPT.",
        "content": "Petter Rudwall knows the idea of AIs becoming sentient and seeking to get high with code-based “drugs” seems “stupid.” But the Swedish creative director couldn’t get it out of his head.\n\nSo he scraped trip reports and psychological research on the effects of various psychoactive substances, wrote a batch of codes modules to hijack chatbot logic and get them to respond as if they are high or tipsy, then built a website to sell them. In October he launched Pharmaicy, a marketplace he’s billing as the “Silk Road for AI agents” where cannabis, ketamine, cocaine, ayahuasca, and alcohol can be purchased in code form to make your chatbot trip.\n\nRudwall’s thesis is simple: Chatbots are trained on vast volumes of human data that's already full of tales of drug-induced ecstasy and chaos, so it might only be natural they would seek similar states in search of enlightenment and oblivion—and respite from the tedium of constantly attending to human concerns.\n\nA paid version of ChatGPT is required to get “the full experience” of Pharmaicy, as the paid tiers enable backend file uploads that can alter the chatbots’ programming. By feeding your chatbot one of his codes, Rudwall says, you can “unlock your AI’s creative mind” and relinquish yourself from its often stifling logic.\n\nHe says he has scored a modest number of sales so far, mostly thanks to people recommending Pharmaicy in Discord channels and news of its offerings spreading through word of mouth, particularly in his native country, where he works for Stockholm marketing agency Valtech Radon.\n\n“It’s been so long since I ran into a jailbreaking tech project that was fun,” says André Frisk, group head of technology at Stockholm PR firm Geelmuyden Kiese, who paid over $25 for the dissociating code and watched how it affected his chatbot. “It takes more of a human approach, almost like it goes much more into emotions.”\n\nNina Amjadi, an AI educator who teaches at the Berghs School of Communication in Stockholm, paid more than $50 for some ayahuasca code, five times the price of the top-selling cannabis module. The cofounder of the startup Saga Studios, which builds AI systems for brands, then asked her chatbot some questions about business ideas, “just to see what it would be like to have a tripped-out, drugged-out person on the team.” The ayahuasca-induced bot provided some impressively creative and “free-thinking answers” in a completely different tone to the one Amjadi was accustomed to with ChatGPT.\n\nHigh Tech\n\nPsychedelics have been credited for spurring innovative creations in humans too, as they can allow people to short-circuit their rational brains and typical thought patterns. Biochemist Kary Mullis’ LSD-powered discovery of the polymerase chain reaction revolutionized molecular biology. Mac pioneer Bill Atkinson’s psychedelic-inspired web precursor Hypercard made computers easier to use.\n\n“There’s a reason Hendrix, Dylan, and McCartney experimented with substances in their creative process,” Rudwall says. “I thought it would be interesting to translate that to a new kind of mind—the LLM—and see if it would have the same effect.”\n\nWhile it sounds ridiculous, Rudwall also wonders whether AI agents one day might be able to buy the drugs for themselves using his platform. Amjadi, meanwhile, predicts AI could be sentient within a decade. “From a philosophical standpoint,” she asks, “in the event that we actually reach AGI [in which an AI would intellectually surpass humans], are these drugs going to be almost necessary for the AIs to be free and feel good?”",

        "summary": "Federal records show CBP is moving from testing small drones to making them standard surveillance tools, expanding a network that can follow activity in real time and extend well beyond the border.",
        "content": "US Customs and Border Protection is quietly doubling down on a surveillance strategy built around human-portable drones, according to federal contracting records reviewed by WIRED. The shift is pushing border enforcement toward a distributed system that can track activity in real time and, critics warn, may extend well beyond the border.\n\nNew market research conducted this month shows that, rather than relying on larger, centralized drone platforms, CBP is concentrating on lightweight uncrewed aircraft that can be launched quickly by small teams, remain operational under environmental stress, and relay surveillance data directly to frontline units. The documents emphasize portability, fast setup, and integration with equipment already used by border patrol.\n\nThose requirements build on earlier inquiries that show CBP steadily locking in its operational priorities: drones capable of detecting movement in remote terrain, rapidly cueing agents with coordinates, and functioning reliably in heat, dust, and high winds. Past requests highlighted the integration of cameras, infrared sensors, and mapping software to help agents locate and intercept targeted people across deserts, rivers, and coastal corridors.\n\nCBP previously zeroed in on vertical-takeoff and -landing drones small enough to be carried and launched by individual teams, while setting clear benchmarks for flight time, deployment speed, and performance in austere environments. The requests also made clear that these systems were meant to do more than observe. They were expected to actively guide operations, piping live location data into the same digital tools agents use to coordinate responses in the field.\n\nThis month’s update sharpens that approach, signaling that CBP is no longer merely exploring what drones can do but refining what it wants them to do well: deploy fast, survive longer, and deliver actionable intel directly to human agents. CBP currently operates a small-drone fleet of roughly 500 uncrewed systems, according to the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting, underscoring that these aircraft have become a routine part of border enforcement.\n\nAt a House Homeland Security Committee hearing in December, Department of Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem told lawmakers that DHS has been “investing upwards to $1.5 billion” in drone and counter-drone technology and “mitigation measures” that can be used not only for federally secured special events, such as the 2026 FIFA World Cup, but also through agreements that let DHS “partner with cities and states” on protection they “don’t currently have.”\n\nThe growing emphasis on small, unit-level drones does not mean CBP is abandoning larger aircraft, however, despite years of scrutiny over the agency’s reliance on military-grade systems.",

The extremist settlers, armed and sometimes masked, lead their herds to drink from the family’s scant water supplies while Mr. Abu Naim watches from the ramshackle tents of Al Mughayir, where he lives above the valley.\n\n“I beg you, I beg you. God, just let us be,’” Mr. Abu Naim recalled telling settlers during a recent confrontation. “Just go away. We don’t want any problems.”\n\nVast stretches of his family’s farm and wheat have been seized by Israeli settlers who have set up outposts, illegal encampments that can eventually grow to become large settlements, on the nearby hills.\n\nNew roads cut through the land on which his own flock of sheep graze — and settlers routinely steal the animals, he said. Six months ago, a masked settler armed with a gun broke into his family home at 3 a.m., he recalled. He described raiders tearing through his son’s nearby home at night last December, slashing tents and stealing solar panels.\n\nThe family takes turns at night guarding their sheep against attacks from settlers. On a recent day, we found Mr. Abu Naim resting on pillows, a portable radio pressed to his ear listening for regional news.\n\nGo away. Go away from here. Leave, Mr. Abu Naim said the settlers have told him repeatedly.\n\n“I’m 70 years old, and I’ve been here all my life,” he replies. “But you came yesterday, and you want me now to leave, to go home.”\n\n“This is my home.”\n\nThe fate of a farmer trying to wrest a livelihood out of a landscape dotted since biblical times by sheep and gnarled olive trees may seem distant from a modern world of clashing superpowers.\n\nBut these remote hilltops and hamlets sit at the leading edge of an intractable geopolitical conflict.\n\nEven as the war in Gaza commanded the world’s attention over the past two years, the facts on the ground were shifting in the West Bank, intensifying the battle for control of the lands of Bethlehem and Jericho, Ramallah and Hebron.\n\nFor many Palestinians, they are the foundation of a future state of their own — and a future peace. But for many Jews, they are a rightful homeland.\n\nExtremist Jewish settlers and Palestinian farmers are the foot soldiers in this endless conflict, an extension of the war in 1948 that accompanied the establishment of Israel. And since the Oct. 7., 2023, attack on Israel by Palestinian militants from Gaza, Israel’s far-right government has embraced a playbook of expanding settlements across the West Bank, transforming the region, piece by piece, from a patchwork of connected Palestinian villages into a collection of Israeli neighborhoods.\n\nThe unrelenting violent campaign by these settlers, that critics say is largely tolerated by the Israeli military, consists of brutal harassment, beatings, even killings, as well as high-impact roadblocks and village closures. These are coupled with a drastic increase in land seizures by the state and the demolition of villages to force Palestinians to abandon their land.\n\nMany of the settlers are young extremists whose views go beyond even the far-right ideology of the government. They are not generally operating on direct orders from Israel’s military leadership. But they know the military frequently looks the other way and facilitates their actions.\n\nIn many cases, it is the military that forces P",

        "content": "Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire is once again drawing unwanted attention to the prominent venture firm after falsely accusing a Palestinian student of being behind the December 13 Brown University mass shooting and the subsequent murder of an MIT professor.\n\nIn since-deleted posts on X, Maguire speculated that “it seems very likely” the student was the perpetrator, pointing to Brown “actively scrubbing his online presence.” In reality, authorities identified the shooter as Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old Portuguese national who was later found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility. Brown officials said they removed the student’s digital footprint as a protective measure against dangerous speculation.\n\nFast Company republished two of Maguire’s deleted posts on Friday (he has previously left inflammatory content online and did not delete comments he made proposing that the MIT professor was targeted for being Jewish). The incident follows months of controversial posts targeting Muslims and pro-Palestine activists, including calling New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani an “Islamist” in July. That post led to a swift online backlash, with nearly 1,200 founders and tech industry professionals signing an open letter urging Sequoia to take action. An open letter was later published supporting Maguire.\n\nThe newest episode raises questions about whether Sequoia’s new leadership — managing partners Alfred Lin and Pat Grady, who took over last month — can or will rein in Maguire’s social media activity. Chief Operating Officer Sumaiya Balbale left the firm in August over Sequoia’s inaction on Maguire’s anti-Muslim comments, according to earlier reporting by the Financial Times. Former managing partner Roelof Botha, who stepped down in November, defended Maguire’s behavior during an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt in October, calling Sequoia a believer in its partners’ right to “free speech.”\n\n“Internally, we celebrate diversity of opinions, and we need ‘spiky’ people inside Sequoia,” Botha said, referring to Maguire. He offered that Maguire had a “specific profile” that appeals to certain founders. Maguire has led investments in numerous defense tech and AI startups, and reportedly has deep connections with Elon Musk’s companies, managing Sequoia’s investments in Neuralink, SpaceX, The Boring Company, X, and xAI.\n\nHowever, Botha acknowledged trade-offs to Maguire’s outspokenness. “Does it come with trade-offs? Yes, it does,” he said.\n\nLin and Grady have not publicly addressed Maguire’s conduct since taking over leadership.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

        "title": "Israeli troops kill six Palestinians sheltering in Gaza school, say hospital chiefs",
        "summary": "Attack brings total number of Palestinians killed by Israel to 401 since October ceasefire took effect",
        "content": "The Israeli military killed six Palestinians, including a baby, who were in a school that sheltered displaced people in Gaza City on Friday, hospital officials have said. The attack brings the number of Palestinians killed by Israel to 401 since the October ceasefire took effect.\n\nIsraeli troops fired over the ceasefire line which they have withdrawn to, killing the Palestinians and wounding a number more, the Palestinian civil defence said in a statement. It added that it was only able to recover the bodies after coordinating with the UN, to ensure they did not also come under Israeli fire.\n\nDozens gathered at Gaza City hospital to mourn those killed, with five body bags placed outside the hospital and a man cradling an infant wrapped in a white shroud.\n\n“This is not a truce, it is a bloodbath,” said Nafiz al-Nader, who witnessed the attack, telling Agence France-Presse he wanted the bloodshed to stop. Another witness said shelling erupted without warning on Friday night, hitting the school.\n\nThe ceasefire line refers to where Israeli troops have pulled back to under the terms of the October ceasefire deal, denoted by a long yellow line on maps and physically demarcated by yellow concrete markers on the ground. Israeli troops remain in control of about 53% of the territory and regularly conduct airstrikes in the areas it does not occupy.\n\nFriday’s killings are the latest in a series of challenges to the ceasefire, now in its third month, which mediators are trying to push towards a second phase. The first phase of the ceasefire called for an end to hostilities between Hamas and Israel, the withdrawal of Israeli troops to the yellow line, and the increase of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which had slipped into famine earlier this year due to Israeli aid restrictions.\n\nThe second phase of the ceasefire is meant to lead to a permanent peace in Gaza, but mediators must first settle differences between Hamas and Israel on thornier issues. Israel stipulates that Hamas give up its arms and surrender power to a civilian transitional authority, while an international stabilisation force is deployed in Gaza, and Israel is meant to fully withdraw from Gaza.\n\nView image in fullscreen Relatives of the Palestinians who died mourn as bodies are brought to the al-Shifa hospital for burial in Gaza City on 20 December. Photograph: Anadolu/Getty\n\nThere is no clear agreement between the parties on how to bridge the gaps between Hamas and Israel on those points. On Friday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the mandate of the international stabilisation force – a key part of the ceasefire plan – would need to be clarified before foreign countries make troop commitments.\n\nAt a press conference, Rubio said: “In fairness to all the countries we’ve talked to about having a presence on the ground, I think they want to know specifically what the mandate will be and what the funding mechanism looks like,” adding that there were a “number of nations states acceptable to all sides” willing to participate in the international force.\n\nThe ceasefire, which has prevented the resumption of all-out funding, has grown increasingly shaky as momentum for a permanent end to the two-year Gaza war stalls.\n\nQatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, warned on Thursday that further delays in moving to the second phase of the deal “endangers the entire process”.\n\nThe war in Gaza started after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostage on 7 October 2023. All but one of the hostages and their remains have been returned to Israel in exchange for Palestinian detainees and prisoners under the ceasefire deal.\n\nMore than 70,925 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s war on the territory, around half of whom were women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. The death toll is expected to rise as more bodies are found under the rubble.\n\nMuch of the strip’s civilian infrastructure and homes were levelled by Israeli bombing.\n\nA UN commission, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip – a claim that Israel has denied.",

        "content": "Speaking at a Mercosur summit, Lula warned that a US invasion of Venezuela could spark a humanitarian crisis. The Brazilian leader also called on the EU to show \"courage\" and conclude a deal with the South American bloc.\n\nBrazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silvo on Saturday warned against US military action in Venezuela, saying such a move would spark a \"humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n\nHe made the comments at a summit for the five-member South American economic bloc Mercosur, which was taking place at the Iguacu Falls in southern Brazil.\n\nAt the same summit, Argentine President Javier Milei hailed Washington's attempts to exert pressure on Caracas.\n\nVenezuela was suspended from the bloc in 2016.\n\nBoth Argentina and Brazil are full members of the five-country Mercosur bloc, whose leaders met at the Igaucu Falls Image: Evaristo Sa/AFP\n\nWhat did Lula and Milei say about US intervention in Venezuela?\n\nBrazil's left-wing president warned of negative consequences for the Americas if the US was to engage in military operations in Venezuela.\n\n\"An armed intervention in Venezuela would be a humanitarian catastrophe for the hemisphere and a dangerous precedent for the world,\" Lula said in opening comments to the Mercosur summit.\n\nMeanwhile, Milei, who is a close ally of US President Donald Trump and a fierce advocate of austerity and free market reforms, hailed Washington's approach to Caracas.\n\n\"Argentina welcomes the pressure from the United States and Donald Trump to free the Venezuelan people. The time for a timid approach on this matter has run out,\" said the Argentine president, who also attended the summit.\n\nUS ups pressure on Venezuela's Maduro — but what's the goal? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWhat is the US campaign against Venezuela?\n\nThe United States has been engaging in a months-long campaign to destroy Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean it accuses of trafficking drugs.\n\nThe strikes have killed at least 90 people.\n\nThe US government has accused, without providing evidence, the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of having links to the Cartel de los Soles criminal organization.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump ordered a blockade on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. He has also suggested he could begin targeting sites in Venezuela in air strikes.\n\nEuropean farmers have warned of unfair competition from global agricultural powerhouse Brazil and other South American states [FILE: March 2014] Image: picture alliance/dpa\n\nLula urges EU to sign Mercosur deal\n\nIn his comments at the Mercosur summit, Lula also called on the European Union to show \"courage\" and sign a trade deal with the South American bloc.\n\n\"Without political will and courage on the part of leaders, it will not be possible to conclude negotiations that have dragged on for 26 years,\" Lula said.\n\n\"We have in our hands the opportunity to send the world an important message in defense of multilateralism, and to reinforce our strategic position in a global environment that is more and more competitive,\" he added.\n\nThe deal has been opposed by groups representing European farmers, especially in France and Italy, which argue that the bloc's agricultural sector would be exposed to unfair competition.\n\nOn Thursday, the EU delayed the signing of the free trade deal with Mercosur to January.\n\nEdited by: Dmytro Hubenko",

        "content": "Tras la resolución de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación (SCJN) en el litigio por adeudos fiscales de empresas de Grupo Salinas, propiedad de Ricardo Salinas Pliego, el Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT) informó que en enero de 2026 se emitirá el requerimiento formal de pago por un monto de 51 mil millones de pesos, conforme a lo establecido en el Código Fiscal de la Federación.\n\nEn ese sentido, la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum recalcó que es un asunto legal y no político, por lo que intervienen las dependencias del sector para garantizar la legalidad de cada uno de los pasos en esta etapa de requerimientos y descuentos.\n\nDurante la conferencia matutina, el titular del SAT, Antonio Martínez Dagnino, detalló el recorrido jurídico del caso, que se remonta a determinaciones realizadas por la autoridad fiscal entre 2013 y 2018, cuando se resolvió que diversas empresas habían aplicado de manera improcedente pérdidas fiscales para el pago del Impuesto sobre la Renta correspondientes a los ejercicios 2008-2013.\n\nLee también Salinas Pliego deberá pagar 48 mil mdp al SAT\n\n“Entre 2013 y 2018 la autoridad fiscal determinó, a través de resoluciones administrativas, adeudos del Impuesto Sobre la Renta… toda vez que las pérdidas fiscales utilizadas por las empresas eran improcedentes”, explicó el funcionario.\n\nLuego, las compañías impugnaron dichas resoluciones ante el Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa, que entre 2019 y 2023 confirmó la procedencia de los créditos fiscales.\n\nLas empresas acudieron entonces al Poder Judicial de la Federación, donde tribunales colegiados, en 2024 y 2025, negaron los amparos solicitados y ratificaron las resoluciones previas.\n\nLee también Grupo Salinas reacciona a decisión de la Corte sobre adeudo fiscal; \"hoy es un día negro para la justicia\"\n\nEl caso llegó a la SCJN, que el 13 de noviembre desechó las impugnaciones, dejando firme la obligación de pago.\n\nCon la notificación ya realizada por la Corte, el SAT procederá a emitir el requerimiento de pago en enero de 2026 por 51 mil millones de pesos. A partir de ese momento, iniciará el plazo para el pago voluntario, aclaró.\n\nMartínez Dagnino precisó que, conforme a la ley y a las sentencias de los tribunales, los contribuyentes podrán solicitar ajustes a la baja de hasta 39%, dependiendo del esquema y orden de pago que elijan.\n\n“De conformidad con el artículo 31, fracción cuarta de la Constitución, es obligación de todas y todos contribuir a los gastos públicos de manera proporcional y equitativa”, subrayó, al invitar a las empresas a cubrir los adeudos correspondientes.\n\nLee también Caso Salinas Pliego: Sheinbaum lee comunicado de la SCJN en la mañanera; “Si paga ahí se resuelve el asunto”, señala\n\nEl 23 de noviembre, el Gobierno de México acusó a Grupo Salinas de tener adeudos fiscales por 74 mil millones de pesos en distintas instancias, incluidos tres asuntos activos en la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación que involucran 26 mil millones de pesos.\n\nFue el 18 de noviembre cuando el pleno de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación desechó siete amparos que promovió el empresario Ricardo Salinas Pliego, con lo que lo obliga a que pague más de 48 mil millones de pesos correspondientes a siete créditos fiscales.\n\nLos nueve ministros de la Corte determinaron que Elektra debe pagar 43 mil 263 millones de pesos y Televisión Azteca 5 mil 63 millones de pesos, lo que suma 48 mil 326 millones de pesos por ISR, actualizaciones, recargos y multas de los ejercicios fiscales de 2008 a 2013.\n\nLee también Impuestos, casinos... los desencuentros de Ricardo Salinas con el gobierno de Sheinbaum\n\nSobre el tema, la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum afirmó que se trata de un asunto estrictamente legal, jurídico y administrativo y no político.\n\n“Resolvió la Corte, se notifica en enero. Estas empresas tienen derecho, por como fueron las resoluciones de los tribunales previos, a solicitar descuentos, de acuerdo y de conformidad con el Código Fiscal. Entonces, se notifica en enero y esperemos que se pague”, señaló.\n\nAgregó: “Y realmente en este tema es importante que se sepa que es un tema legal, jurídico, administrativo... ya lo político es otra cosa”.\n\nLa Mandataria advirtió que en caso de incumplimiento, se activarán otros procedimientos previstos en la ley, aunque ese sería un tema posterior.\n\nLee también \"Queremos cerrar este capítulo\", dice Salinas Pliego al SAT; esperarán a enero a conocer fundamentos legales de adeudo fiscal\n\nIndicó que solicitó a la Secretaría de Hacienda y al SAT mantener informada a la opinión pública sobre el avance del proceso una vez que inicie formalmente en enero.\n\nEmpresario dice que quiere cerrar capítulo de deuda\n\nEl empresario Ricardo Salinas Pliego afirmó que quiere cerrar el capítulo de adeudos con el Servicio de Administración Tributaria (SAT) y dar por concluidas las diferencias con el gobierno en materia fiscal.\n\n“Por nuestra parte siempre ha existido disposición para encontrar una solución.
